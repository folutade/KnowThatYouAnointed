#### "I think it's time to watch the party die" > Pedophile parties

* “Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham who is better known by his middle name Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.  
 
  * *Dear **Aubrey**  
  I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to **crash your party***  

* The first line of "Watch the Party Die" thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick's battle with Drake.  
 
* Among the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.  

  * *Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen  
  Mm-mm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, **I think niggas like him should die**  
  **Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life**  
  He **hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish**  
  Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better  
  **He got sex offenders on ho-VO** that he keep on a monthly allowance  
  A **child should never be compromised** and he keepin' his child around them  
  And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' **there's predators like him lurkin'**  
  ...  
  **They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home** and callin' 'em tender  
  Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas  
  ...  
  **Katt Williams said, "Get you the truth,"** so I'ma get mines  
  **The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time**  
  Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away  
  To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away  
  They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away  
  I'm **lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe***  

* In these lyrics from "meet the grahams", Kendrick asserts that sexual predators like Drake or Harvey Weinstein should die, much like the party in "Watch the Party Die".
 
* Kendrick also recounts a message from Black comedian, Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth”. Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview which was released by Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these predatory practices.  
 
* Years before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offences and been given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since at the time Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assaut but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the [interview (15:40 - 16:32)](https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=iKsx-nqFoDQbiOnu&t=940) Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.  

  * ***I came in this business saying I was going to expose**. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. **It's God's side and the other side** and we don't care nothing about the other side - period. Period. **All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024**. It's up for all of them. **It don't matter if you Diddy or whoever you is**. TD Jakes - any of them the every…**All lies will be exposed**. That's all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. **The truth is the light**.  
  ...  
  All people that love the truth got to be happy if **the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That's just what time it is - 2024**, folks.*  
 
* In the [interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)](https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&t=6033), Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy's parties and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities he consistently refused to attend the parties because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy's "Freak Off" sex parties.  

  * ***My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis**. That was my only goal.  
  ...  
  **I've had to turn down $50 million four times** - four times - just **to protect my integrity and that virgin hole** I was telling you about, right. Cause **P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, "No."** You've got to tell him, "No." I did.*  
 
* Hence by saying “I think **it’s time** to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with - or maybe fulfilling - Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them”.  
 
* Again, the idea that it is almost "time" for the criminal offences of Drake and his crew will soon be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on "meet the grahams" when he predicted a police raid on Drake's mansion, which is nicknamed "The Embassy".

  * ***Katt Williams said, "Get you the truth,"** so I'ma get mines  
  **The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time***  

* A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would go on to release the album *GNX* featuring the opening track “wacced out murals” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that truth is about to be exposed.

  * *Ayy, **fuck anybody empathetic to the other side**, I vow  
  A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style  
  Exterminate 'em right now  
  **Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud***

* It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized allegations.  
 
* For instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14 year old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31 year old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently including Drake sending a message that said “I miss you so much” to which she replied “I miss you more”. She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.  
 
* A year later, in 2019, roughly 5 years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes 'em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next 5 years.

  * *“Dude R. Kelly got away”  
     
  "That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake's gonna be …he's on that R. Kelly tip."  
     
  “You think so?”  
     
  "Drizzy **Drake likes 'em young**. He does. It's somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, 'I don't know.' Drake, Drizzy **Drake is into the young ones**. **He's going to get got in the next 5 years**, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake."*  
 
* Kendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us”. In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.  

  * *Say, **Drake, I hear you like 'em young**  
  You better not ever go to cell block one  
  To any bitch that talk to him and they in love  
  Just **make sure you hide your lil' sister from him**  
  They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs  
  And **Party at the party playin' with his nose** now  
  And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?  
  **Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles**  
  Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up  
  Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff  
  Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?  
  **Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor***

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Perverting God's plan">}}

#### "I think it's time to watch the party die" > Perverting God's plan

* The pedophelia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees

  * ***Devil is a lie, he a 69 God**, ayy  
  ...  
  The family matter and the truth of the matter  
  **It was God's plan to show y'all the liar**  
  He a fan, he a fan, he a fan  
  He a fan, he a fan, he a  
  **Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god**  
  **Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god**  
  Hey, hey, hey, hey, **run for your life**  
  Hey, hey, hey, hey, **run for your life***  
 
* The association with simultaneous oral sex is due to the fact that the number 6 looks like a number 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees  
 
* Aside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament the "devil" (meaning "diabolical one", "false accuser" or "liar" ) - also known as the "satan" (meaning "adversary") - is often depicted as a figure who unlike God cannot actually create anything. Instead the "devil" / "satan" will take things that have been created by the one true God and uses lies to twist or turn them upside down.  

* In his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the "devil" / "satan" cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.

  * *These people are not powerful. **Satan can't create anything** that includes blessings for his people. That's why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn't happen. They all do the same job.*  
 
* In English the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the "devil" / "satan" or someone who behaves like the "devil" / "satan" uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing towards an evil purpose. The word "pervert" is derived from the Latin word “perverto” which means “to turn thoroughly”. Someone who habitually "perverts" good things can themselves be refered to with the noun "pervert". Notably, Kendrick refered to Drake as a "pervert" on "meet the graham".

  * *I'm lookin' to shoot through any **pervert** that lives, keep the family safe* 
 
* Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake - the self-proclaimed “6 god” - has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan”, in reference to Drake's hit single.  
 
* Ultimately, the goal of the "devil" / "satan" is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God”. This pattern of lying is first depicted when the "devil" / "satan" takes on the form of snake which deceives the prototypical man and woman to eat the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.

  * *Now **the snake was more shrewd** than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he **said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?**”  
     
  The woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but **from the fruit of the tree** which is in the middle of the garden, **God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die**.’”  
     
  The snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and **you will become like God**, knowing good and evil.”  
     
  When the **woman saw that the tree** was good for food, and that it **was a delight to the eyes**, and that the tree **was desirable** to make one wise, **she took some of its fruit and ate**; and she also **gave some to her husband with her, and he ate**.*  
 
* In the case of Kendrick's allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to reprsent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Sex god">}}

#### "I think it's time to watch the party die" > Sex god

* Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to a sexual acts, Kendrick seems to depicting Drake as a “sex god”. In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus and Liber were worshiped throughout the world including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East where most of the events of the Bible take place.  
 
* In many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.  
 
* In the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and  destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.  
 
* Hence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Drake denies the allegations">}}

#### "I think it's time to watch the party die" > Drake denies the allegations

* After the release of "meet the grahams" and "Not Like Us", Drake released “The Heart Part 6” where Drake publicly denied the pedophelia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick's own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick's track "mother i sober" from **Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers**. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.

  * ***Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that now**  
  **This Epstein angle was the shit I expected**  
  TikTok videos you collected and dissected  
  Instead of bein' on some diss-direct shit  
  You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit  
  My mom came over today, and I was like, "Mother, I—  
  Mother, I—, mother—," ahh, wait a second  
  That's that one record where you say you got molested  
  Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection  
  This about to get so depressin'  
  **This is trauma from your own confessions**  
  This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected  
  That's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive  
  They actin' like it's so aggressive, but you just never known affection  
  **I don't wanna diss you anymore**, this really got me second-guessin'  
  "Touch My Body" by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin'  
  I never been with no one underage,  
  but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with  
  Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected  
  **If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested  
  I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested**  
  But that's not the lesson, clearly, there's a deeper message*  
  ...  
  **Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list**, Eazy-Duz-It
  You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, "Who was it?"
  You thought you left D flat, D major 
  ...   
  **Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager**  
  ...  
  **If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior**

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Wickedness or weakness" >}}

#### "This shit done got too wicked to apologize" > Wickedness or weakness

* Kendrick seems to be asserting that "the party" has become become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending "the party" have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.  
 
* Kendrick's accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy's "Freak Off" sex parties which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficing, recketeering transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry as exposed by Katt Williams.  
 
* It is notable that that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album *DAMN.*. The album's opening track, "BLOOD." begins with the with an ominous voice which that says:

  * *Is it **wickedness** or is it **weakness**?  
  You decide. Are we going to **live** or **die**?”*  
 
* Throughout *DAMN.* Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the "wickedness" that is routinely perpetrated by poweful, violent men in this world and the "weakness" that was exhibited by Jesus who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men. 

  * *Love's gonna get you killed  
  But pride's gonna be the death of you, and you and me*  
  -"PRIDE."  
     
  * *Damn, love or lust  
  Damn, all of us*  
  -"LOVE"  
     
  * *Hail Mary, **Jesus**, and Joseph  
  The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives  
  Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters  
  Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us  
  **It's murder** on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street  
  Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with  
  **Homicidal thoughts**, Donald Trump's in office  
  We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again  
  But **is America honest or do we bask in sin?***  
  -"XXX."  
     
  * *I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity  
  I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me  
  I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride  
  'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God  
  I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone  
  I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more  
  I'm talkin' fear, **fear that it's wickedness or weakness**  
  Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive  
  Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth  
  And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse  
  Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax  
  Searchin' for resolutions **until somebody get back**  
  Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth  
  And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse  
  Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax  
  **Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap**  
  Damn*  
  -"FEAR."

* Give that throughout *DAMN.* Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from way of wickeness would require him to turn towards Jesus's way of weakess, it is ironic that throughout "Watch the Party Die" Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultanelous building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible" >}}

#### "This shit done got too wicked to apologize" > Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible

* Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of "Watch the Party Die", it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at "the party" are "too wicked to apologize."  
 
* In a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men whar are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels form getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone and the city soon gets destroyed by a fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.  
 
* In a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor's wife leads to a civil war where thousand of men are killed. We war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed feast capture teenage girls from festal celebrationand force them into marriage.  
 
* In a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David immediately is overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman's name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David's army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba has be pregnant he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.  
 
  * Lecrae refernces this story of King David's sexual misconduct with Bathseba and murder of Uriah on "Die for the Party" when he raps:  

    * *But when I take a look in the mirror  
    The **blood of Uriah's on my hands 'cause I'm that killer**  
    Who **had Bathsheba in his quarters***  
 
* God soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51 in which King Devil acknowleges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness  
 
* That being said, despite King David's repentance, the son that was born from King David's adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David's second son - who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped - exeuted a plot to murder the oldest son. King David's second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to raped all of King David’s lower status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.  
 
* One of the major lessons of King David's story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real world consequences for David, his family and the whole society around King David.  
 
* Kendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick's album *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, Kendrick released the track "The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)" where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.

  * ***With a Bible and rifle**: I play the game as I "blam-blaow!"  
  Holler back at me, nigga  
  And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?  
  'Cause when the whole world see you as 'Pac reincarnated  
  **Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David  
  And pray to God that you make it** or live your life in The Matrix  
  'Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it's quite contagious*  
 
* Given that Kendrick knows the story of King David wicked behavior and subsequent aplology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy or or any of the men who have participated in "the party" can ever truly apology or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.  
 
* From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that would him to justify the use of violence eliminate his enemies or those whom he considers to be an enemy of society, which is exactly what he does throughout the rest of "Watch the Party Die".

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Wacced out partygoers" >}}

#### "It's different, get him wacced and disqualified" > Wacced out partygoers

* By saying "It's different", Kendrick seems to be suggesting that the wickedness of the hosts and attendees of "the party" is on a totally different level than other negative behavior or even criminal offences that could be considered forgivable. From Kendrick's perspective, this different level of wickedness seems be justice getting these partygoers "wacced" and "disqualified".  
 
* "Wacced" is slang for destroyed, defaced or disrespected.  
 
* The use of the word "wacced" would go on to become more notable a few months after the release of "Watch the Party Die" when Kendrick released the album *GNX* which opens with the track "wacced out murals". On "wacced out murals", Kendrick expresses anger after an unknown graffiti vandalizer "wacced out" a mural on the side of a Compton restaurant that a visual artist had created to honor Kendrick. The vandlism included Kendrick's face covered with the letter "OVO" in reference to Drake's OVO crew and record label which is a acronym for "October's Very Own".  

  * ***Yesterday, somebody wacced out my mural**  
  That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe  
  But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure  
  The **love and hate is definite** without a cure*  
 
* A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqflSI6KIoE) of the vandalizer spraying graffiti on Kendrick's mural was first posted to social media on September 8, 2024, just 3 days before the release of "Watch the Party Die." One could reasonably suppose that the release of "Watch the Party Die" on September 11 was partially a response to Kendrick's mural getting vandalized.  
 
* One can also reasonably argue that “wacced out murals” is essentially a simplified spiritual successor to “Watch the Party Die”. "wacced out murals" seems crafted to allow listeners to "feel" the vitriol of "Watch the Party Die" without having to closely analyize the lyrics and discover the double entendres. This connection can be seen in the verses of “wacced out murals” where Kendrick threatens to “eliminate” anyone who is on “the other side” (i.e. not on God’s side). The third verse in particular also contains a direct reference to “Watch the Party Die” and to Katt Williams calling for the truth to be exposed.  

  * *It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural  
  **Fuck everybody**, that's on my body  
  **My blick first**, then God got me  
  ...  
  **This is not for lyricists**, I swear it's not the sentiments  
  **Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit**  
  ...  
  Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal  
  Since y'all pandering to **choose a side**, let me do it for you  
  Okay, fuck your hip-hop, **I watched the party just die**  
  Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial  
  ...  
  Ayy, **fuck anybody empathetic to the other side**, I vow  
  A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style  
  **Exterminate 'em right now**  
  **Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud**  
  ...  
  I know propaganda work for them, and **fuck whoever that's close to them**  
  The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, **slide on both of them***
 
* Someone is typically "disqualified" from an activity or competition when they are exposed for lying, cheating or behaving in a way that is illegal or unethical. In the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick could be saying that rappers like Drake should be disqualified from the “rap game” or more specifically from the competition of being considered the greatest rapper.  
 
* At the same time, based on the violent language throughout “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick might also be claiming that the hosts and attendees of “the party” should be disqualified from the most basic activity of living life.

#### "We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives" > Killing the killers

* Kendrick seems to indicate that he and the peopole associated with him have already decided to kill anyone who is guilty of killing someone innocent.  
 
*  The first three lines of "Watch the Party Die" have expressed significant amounts of animosity and vitriol. However, this fourth line is the first instance where Kendrick explicitly advocates for death sentences and targeted executions as an act of vigilante justice where an individual or group without any legal authority decide to take the law into their own hands in order to punish offenders or address perceived injustices. Within the context of this track, Kendrick is establishing himself as the judge and jury while enlisting his supporters to join him as executioners.  
 
* The idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” brings up a longstanding political, sociological and philosophical debate about the best way to respond to potential wrongdoing, establish justice and maintain an orderly society. Within the large debate it should be noted that more than 50 countries including the United States of America currently  execute individuals who have been convincted of a crime that the justice system considers particularly egregious or distabilizing to social order.  
 
* In America, crimes that are eligible for the death penalty tend to be ones that invole intentionally or unintentionally killing someone innocent whether through murder, terrorism, kidnapping, sexual assault, or drug trafficking. In contrast, European countries in the European Union have abolished the death penalty as punishment for crimes. However, historically most civilizations in human history have had some form of death penalty, often for crimes that did not involve killing anyone - including theft, adultery, sexual misbehavior, disrespecting a member of a higher class, and speaking against the state government or the state religion.  
 
* While America and many other modern nations still justify the use of death sentences after a fair trial, all modern nation states - at least officially - oppose the use of individuals or groups taking the law into their own hands through vigilante justice. However, on an individual basis, many people do seem ready to accept, support and even celebrate a vigilante execution that is executed against someone whom they truly despise, even if that person has not broken any laws.

#### "We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives" > Current events

* A few months after the release of "Watch the Party Die" this inclination for Americans to accept, support and even celebrate vigilante executions came to the surface after a 26-year old named Luigi Mangione gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare medical health insurance company. According to publish excerpts from Luigi Mangione's writings, he claims to have targed the UnitedHealthcare CEO due to his belief that UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies "have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit".  
 
* Immediately after the shooting and even before his identity was uncovered, [Luigi Magnione became a kind of a folk hero](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/luigi-mangione-and-the-making-of-a-modern-antihero) as countless people across social media platforms expressed agreement with the Mangione's assessment that "these parasites simply had it coming" and joined the shooter in expressing anger and vitriol against health insurance companies. This sentiment was widely expressed that Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsyvania were Mangione was arrested, gave a [press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G-cPdWNiE) where he said "In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero hear me on this he is no hero."  
 
* On an international, geopolitical scale, the idea of it being justified and even necessary to "kill the killers" has also been expressed in the context of war. In 2024, much of this justification has come from manypeople on both sides of the Israel vs. Hamas conflict that began on October 7, 2023, 11 months before the release of "Watch the Party Die" after Hamas killed 1,195 Israelis, took 248 Israelis as hostages and - based on a few sources - sexually assaulted and gang raped numerous Israelis during the October 7 attack. Many people who supported the plight of the Palestinians justified the attack as a necessary response to how Israelis had previously killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Meanwhile, many supporter of Israel's War in Gaza justified killing the killers of innocent Israelies even tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed and two thirds of Gaza's buildings were damaged or destroyed.  
 
* While "Watch the Party Die" does not specifially address current events such at the War in Gaza and was released months before Luigi Mangione's vigilante execution, both of these current events reveal the cultural zeigtgeist in which which Kendrick wrote, recorded and released "Watch the Party Die".

#### "We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives" > Kendrick's catalogue

* Kendrick has explored the idea of killing the killers at length in his previous work most notably on the track “XXX.” from *DAMN*. On the first verse of "XXX." Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) tells a story about a distressed friend who asked for advice on how to respond after gang members killed his son. Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) acknowledged that as a anointed (i.e. Christian) individual he theoretically knew better, but felt strongly that the friend should kill his sons killer.   

  * *Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101  
  Said **they killed his only son** because of insufficient funds  
  He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk  
  Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done  
  **He said, "K-Dot, can you pray for me?** It been a fucked up day for me  
  **I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"**  
  He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer  
  To the spiritual, **my spirit do know better, but I told him**  
  "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, **this is how I feel**  
  **If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed**  
  Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of  
  All the memories collected, moments you could never touch  
  I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block  
  I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got  
  **I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap**  
  Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that"  
  Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward  
  I can't even keep the peace, **don't you fuck with one of ours  
  It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour***  
 
* Meanwhile the second verse of "XXX." explored how the inclination towards violence and killing the killers is a common pattern of thought within the American psyche in contrast to the mentality that was exemplified by Jesus. 

  * *Hail Mary, **Jesus**, and Joseph  
  The great **American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives**  
  **Compulsive disorder**, sons and daughters  
  Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us  
  **It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street  
  Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with  
  Homicidal thoughts**, Donald Trump's in office  
  We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again  
  But **is America honest or do we bask in sin?**  
  Pass the gin, **I mix it with American blood  
  Then bash him** in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?  
  I'll ask again, oops, accident  
  It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up  
  **You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us**  
  **Gang members or terrorists**, et cetera, et cetera  
  **America's reflections of me**, that's what a mirror does*
 
* It is also notable that on “Worldwide Steppers” from *Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper* Kendrick asserted that we are all killers who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly cause the deaths of innocent people.  

  * ***I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer**, bitch  
  **We some killers**, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch  
  ..  
  **Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers**  
  Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)  
  Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies  
  You either gon' be dead or in jail, **killer psychology**  
  Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?  
  Objectified so many bitches, **I killed their confidence** (What the—)  
  The media's the new religion, **you killed the consciousness** (What the fuck?)  
  Your jealousy is way too pretentious, **you killed accomplishments** (What the fuck?)  
  **Niggas killed freedom of speech**, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)  
  ..  
  **I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community**  
  My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies  
  Not because the rags in the park had red gradient  
  But **because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'**  
  So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?  
  More fatalities and reality bring you closure  
  **The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?  
  Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower***  
 
* If we apply the logic of "Wordlwide Steppers" to this current line on "Watch the Party Die", the natural conclusion would suggest that beyond the powerful men who exploit, coerce and sexually abuse victims at parties, there is a much wider set of people whom Kendrick could justifiable kill through his vigilante executions.  
 
* At the same time, we should note that on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick first and foremost acknowledges that he himself is a killer in part due to his catering choices which might lead innocent children to long-term health complications and shortened lifespans. If we apply that logic from “Worldwide Steppers” to this line from “Watch the Party Die” it would seem that Kendrick is being a hypocrite for justifying his desire to kill the people who he despises while not acknowledging that he also deserves to be killed.  
 
* In contrast, on “Die for the Party” Lecrae looks at the man in the mirror, sees that he himself is a killer and a hyprocrite which leads him to acknowledge that he deserves death along with all the other hypocrites.  

  * *It's **killers** sittin' in they cell for **takin' somebody innocent**  
  And they don't even feel no remorse, **the worst ignorance**  
  **But when I take a look in the mirror**  
  The **blood of Uriah's on my hands 'cause I'm that killer**  
  Who had Bathsheba in his quarters  
  I'm that- who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I'm that sinner  
  **I deserve death along with all these liars and hypocrites***

#### "Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time" > Justification

* Burning the whole village with men, women and children would normally be seen as an act of injustice and inhumane brutality. However, if everyone is a killer, Kendrick seems to have no issue with any collateral damage that he would cause while trying to exterminate the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party”.  
 
* The justification for burning the whole village naturlaly follows from the idea that we are all killers and the idea that we should kill the killers who like taking innocent lives.  
 
* By saying “it’s really that time”, Kendrick connects the idea of burning the whole village to the opening line “I think it’s time to watch the party die”.  

{{< / details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament" >}}

#### "Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time" > Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament

* From a biblical perspective, the idea of a whole village being burned does bring to mind the Old Testament story of Sodom and Gomorrah where two towns of rapists were destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies, as I mentioned in the ["Wicked sexual misbehavior in the Bible"](#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible) section.  
 
* The motif of fire coming down from the sky gets further developed in the stories about the Prophet Elijah, who served as a prophet to the Northern Kingdom of Israel which had its capital in a city called Samaria.  
 
* Around 50 years earlier The Northern Kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria had split from the Southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem after a rebellion and a near civil war.  
 
  * This split would be the begnning of a animosity between Samaria and Judah that would continue to escalate for centuries.  
    
  * In English, the name Judah which was later shortened to the word "Jew", which is the word that is now used to refer to the ethnic group that is originally from this geographic area and the religion that was originally practided by this ethnic group.  
 
* At the time, Israel had almost entirely turned away from worshiping God and were instead worship a fertility and sex god named Ba’al. As part of the worship of this fertility god, the Isrealites presumably would have been going to the god Ba’al’s temple to participate in feasts and have ritualized sex with temple prostitutes.  
  
* The worship of Ba’al was introduced to the Kingdom of Israel by a king named Ahab who “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” King Ahab married a princess named Jezebel from one of the neighboring nations which God had specifically forbidden the Israelites from entering into marriage relationships because those nations worshiped false gods like the fertility god Ba’al.  
 
* According to a prophesy from Elijah, God stopped the sky from raining any water to prove that worshiping the fertility and sex god Ba’al would actually diminish the land’s agricultural fertility and, as a consequence, also diminish the sexual fertility amongst the Israelites. This prophesy angered King Ahab and Queen Jezebel who then unsuccessfully tried to murder Elijah.  
 
* At some point after Ahab’s son succeeded Ahab as king, God sent Elijah to confront the king about the ongoing worship of Ba’al. The king sent a military captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah. However, Elijah called down fire from the skies which came down and burned the captain and all the soldiers to death. he king then sent another captain with fifty of soldiers to kill Elijah but they too were burned to death when Elijah called down fire from the skies. Finally, a last captain of fifty soldiers came and humbled himself before Elijah, who this time did not call down fire on the soldiers. (See [2 Kings 1:1-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%201%3A1-15&version=NASB))

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament" >}}

#### "Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time" > Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament

* Given the motif of fire raining down from the skies to destroy the wicked in the Old Teastament, it is notable that one particular New Testament story in St. Luke's account of the Gospel (aka "Good News") seems to intentionally undermine the desire one might have for God to send fire to destroy one's enemies. (See [Luke 9:52-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209%3A52-56&version=NASB))  
 
* In that story, Jesus and his disciple go to a village in Samaria, the same city where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had long ago led the Israelites to worship the fertility and sex god, Ba’al.  
 
* During the time of Jesus, the people of Samaria did worship Yahweh the God of Israel, but the Samaritans and the Judeans considered each other to be be enemies because:  
 
  * The Judeans considered the Samaritans to be “heretics” who did not worship Yahweh in the way that Yahweh was supposed to be worshiped.  
 
  * About 550 years earlier, the Samaritans had tried to prevent the Judeans from building a temple in Jerusalem.  
 
  * About 140 years earlier, earlier there was a military campaign in which the Judeans from Jerusalem destroyed the Samaritan’s temple to Yahweh, killed lots of people and destroyed their capital city.  

* As Jesus entered the Sameritan village, Jesus's followers announced him as the rightful king of the Judeans who was on his way to Jerusalem to be crowned and enthroned as king. However, due the the longstanding hatred between Judeans and Samaritans, the Samaritans did not accept Jesus and expressed visible hostility to Jesus’s arrival.  
 
* Two of Jesus’s disciples, St James and St. John, seemed to have been greatly displeased by the cold reception that the Samaritans were giving to Jesus. Likey influenced by their own hatred of the Samaritans, Jesus’s two disciples asked Jesus:  

  * "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"  

* Jesus immediately became angry with those two disciples and strongly criticized them by saying:

  * “You do not know what kind of spirit you belong to. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy human lives, but to \[save / rescue / heal\] them.”

    * Note: The term “Son of Man” is how Jesus typically referred to himself in the Gospel accounts (See the Bible Project [Son of Man video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6cWEcqxhlI)).
 
* By expressinging his desire to “burn the whole village”, Kendrick seems to be exhibiting the same misguided way of thought as the disciples who wanted to destroy their enemies in the name of serving Jesus. In doing so, James, John and Kendrick totally disregarded Jesus’s desire to have his enemies apologize, repent and allow Jesus to save, rescue, and heal their lives.

#### "Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time" > Current events

* Within the context of current events in 2024, one can also see the Israeli military action against Hamas and the resulting damage or destruction of two thirds of buildings in Gaza an example of the Israeli government deciding that it is justifable to “burn the whole village” in order to kill the killers who executed the October 7, 2023 attack.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Justification">}}

#### "Why reason...Why reason..." > Justification

* Kendrick seems to claim that it is futile to use reason or rational arguments to convince the wicked party hosts and attendees to change their ways. These statements seem to provide further justification for his desire to kill anyone who has taken innocent lives.  

{{< / details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Future first">}}

#### "Why reason with these niggas if they can't see the future first?" > Future first

* The phrase “see the future first” could be a reference to Frank Ocean’s track, “Nikes”.  

  * ***We'll let you guys prophesy**  
  **We gon' see the future first**  
  Living so the last night feels like a past life  
  Speakin' of the, don't know what got into people  
  **Devil be possessin homies**  
  **Demons try to body jump***  

* In the context of “Nikes”, the people who “see the future first” seem to be the ones who truly have a prophetic vision. These true prophets stand in contrast to those who talk as if they can prophesy but are not actually able to see the future in advance.  
 
* Kendrick has repeatedly identified himself as a prophet most prominently on the final track of *To Pimp a Butterfly* and on several tracks that were released in subsequent years.
 
  * *I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome  
  You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing  
  But **a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question**  
  When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?*  
  -"Mortal Man"  
     
  * *The reason my power's here on earth  
  Salute the truth, when **the prophet say**  
  I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA*  
  -"DNA."  
     
  * *I'm not a trending topic, **I'm a prophet**  
  I answer to Metatron and Gabriel*  
  -"family ties"

* In the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick also seems to compare himself and the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry to the biblical prophet Elijah and the wicked Queen Jezebel who tried to imprison and kill all the true prophets of God who spoke truth while giving prominent positions to false prophets who told lies.  

  * *It's cynical to say I know these **artists** petrified  
  The end result, in **jail by Jezebel** or **drugged up full of lies***  

* Hence, we could interpret the current line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to reason with rappers and members of the entertainment industry who profit from telling lies.  

{{< / details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Circus clowns">}}

#### "Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work?" > Circus clowns

* The word “clown” is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who acts foolishly in a way that attracts a lot of attention.  
 
* The word “circus” can also be used as a pejorative to describe an environment that is overcrowded, noisy and chaotic. This pejorative meaning of the word “circus” could potentially be used to description of the “party”, particularly since a party and a circus are both forms of communal entertainment.  
 
* Hence, we could interpret this line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to argue with the rappers who and members of the entertainment industry who are working for the circus.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Walk down">}}

#### "Just walk that man down, that'll do everyone a solid" > Walk down

* "Walking someone down" is a slang term which refers to premediated murder, particularly in a shooting where the shooter calmly executes his target.  
 
* In “euphoria” Kendrick confronts Drake while rapping:  

  * Have you ever **walked your enemy down** like with a poker face?  
 
* Here in "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick seems to inciting his supporters to kill the killers who like taking innocent lives. Kendrick justifies such murders by saying it will “do everyone a solid” which is a colloquial way of saying that killing such people will do everyone a favor.   
 
* Similar to earlier line where Kendrick said [“We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives”](#we-even-kill-the-killers-cause-they-like-taking-innocent-lives--current-events), it seems approximate to point out that a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” this logic was used by significant numbers of people to justify Luigi Mangione’s decision to kill the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. For example, in one [popular video](https://youtu.be/KVsu-FHFds8?si=wNtKpbip_tFJOtl3) the host defends the shooters actions and fittingly refers to the shooter as "Run 'em down Jake" prior to the shooter's name being discovered and publicized.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Tough love">}}

#### "It's love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence" > Tough love

* The term "tough love" is stereotypically used by parents (particularly dads) to refer to painful discipline that is meant to benefit a child in the long run.  
 
* Kendrick specifically mentions “tough love” to describe the parenting Kendrick received from his father on the *Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper* track “Father Time”.

  * *Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "**Fuck a foul**"  
  I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
  ...  
  Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don't take those well  
  Momma said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "**Go fuck yourself  
  If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch**  
  You could be a bitch or step out the margin," I got up quick  
  I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance  
  Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent  
  Oh, this the part, **he breaks my humility just for practice**  
  Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues  
  ...  
  **Early mornin' wake-ups** (Ah), **practicin' on day-offs** (Ah)  
  **Tough love** (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)  
  ...  
  I got daddy issues, that's on me  
  Lookin' for, "I love you", **rarely empathizin' for my relief**  
  A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee  
  'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely **tell me not to be weak**  
  Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself  
  **Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped***  

* It is notable that “Father Time” is one of the few tracks where Kendrick mentioned Drake by name prior to the feud.

  * ***Daddy issues kept me competitive**, that's a fact, nigga  
  I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga  
  **When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused**  
  Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do*  

* Given that on "Father Time" Kendrick higlighted how “tough love” can instill unhealthy patterns of thoughts and lead to immature competitiveness, it is ironic for inconisistent for Kendrick to justify the use of violence against his enemies by claiming it is a result of “tough love".  
 
* Kendrick also hinted at the idea of tough love leading to violence on “euphoria” when alluded to rapper YNW Melly. YNW Melly, whose legal last name is ironically "Demons", released a hit single called "Murder on My Mind” in June 2018 just a few months before a shooting in which he was later accused of murdering two of his close friends, rappers YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.  

  * It's **three GOATs left**, and I seen **two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage**  
  I love 'em to death and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh  
  ...  
  I pray they my real friends, if not, **I'm YNW Melly** .

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Gluttony">}}

#### "If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth" > Gluttony

* Kendrick now seems to be targeting rappers, social media influencers and other members the entertainment industry who glorify greed, instant gratification and conspicuous, unhealthy consumption, particularly when such individuals never actually offer truth to innocent youth whose lives may be shortened if they immitate the examples that are given to them by the entertainment indudstry.  
 
* Kendrick has discussed the theme of unhealthy consumption throughout his career.  
 
* The track “Vanity Slaves” from the *Kendrick Lamar EP* explores the ways in which Black people in America have become enslaved to White-owned businesses and corporations who lead Black people into financial mismanagement and ruin. From this perspective, Kendrick could make a compelling case that parading gluttony leads to generational racial injustice that dehumanizes Black people much like slavery.  

  * ***I care about my pride too much**  
  **If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush**  
  If my hair is cut, **if my diamonds is crushed**  
  I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong  
  **Insecurity roams the black community  
  Homes where kids must have jewelry**  
  The high school female need earrings and details  
  **So she can be cool** to be amongst popularity  
  The various **name brands** that reached the price scan  
  It's not about the right price but more like the right scam  
  **To rule us all, confuse us all**  
  Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw  
  Now let's draw  
  The picture of **a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for**  
  My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house  
  That lives around his neck like a white collar  
  So why fast forward? Then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to **slavery times**  
  Pickin' cotton from a field that a white man own  
  The blacker you are farther you from the white man's home  
  Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity  
  Before your vanity, they parted our families  
  They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed  
  The more we were afraid, the more they made rules  
  And **trapped our minds in a cage**, our freedom was so vague  
  ...  
  Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot  
  Called us niggers and figured that we'd never live in **pursuit  
  Of happiness**, we capture these feelings in things that we do  
  Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to  
  About a perspective, **my shoe selection gotta be Louie  
  Her hand bag gotta be Gucci**, it's fake then she fool me  
  She still bad though and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though  
  We fillin' up the gas for **Rollies**  
  Upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin' **Kobes**  
  My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya  
  He overcompensate for the life of his ancestors  
  So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw  
  The reason why the next four-hundred **we gotta floss  
  Slaves**  
  ...  
  I said the four-hundred years we never had nothin'  
  Barely had clothes on our back  
  Is the reason why **when we get a little bit of change  
  We over exaggerate on our livin' expenses**  
  So **if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house**  
  You're a vanity slave  
  If you're a female and you **got four, five, six rings on your finger**  
  **Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin'**  
  You're a vanity slave  
  **If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it  
  And on the back of the window it says, "Get on my level, ho"  
  You're a vanity slave  
  We all vanity slaves***  

* On the track “Alright” followed by “For Sale? \(Interlude\)” on *To Pimp a Butterfly*, parading gluttony to tempt young Black people is a satanic plot that is utilized by Lucy \(aka Lucifer / the satan / the devil / the false accuser / the adversary / the diabolical one\). 

  * ***What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?  
  Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?  
  Anything, see my name is Lucy**, I'm your dog  
  Motherfucker, **you can live at the mall**  
  I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal  
  I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero  
  Thinkin' of my partner, **put the candy paintin' on the Regal**  
  Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you  
  Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you  
  In the presence of your chico, ah*  
  -"Alright"
     
  ***My name is Lucy, Kendrick**, you introduced me, Kendrick  
  Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick  
  **Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories  
  About these rappers that I came after** when they was boring  
  **Lucy gon' fill your pockets  
  Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton  
  Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised  
  Lucy just want your trust and loyalty**, avoiding me?  
  It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly*  
  -"For Sale (Interlude)"  
  
* On “LUST.” Kendrick raps from the perspective of a man and a woman who is being controlled by demonic forces and driven towards an endless routine of conspicuous, unhealthy consumption. Within the logic of “LUST” demonic forces seem to be at work under the surface in ways that we normally don’t notice and thus don’t realize how Black people are being enslaved in a way that is arguably too wicked to apologize.  

  * ***Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money**, kick your feet up  
  Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then **roll some weed up**  
  **Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today  
  Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks** and make it work today  
  Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama  
  **Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window**  
  Bet your favorite team, **play you some Madden  
  Go to the club** or your mama house  
  Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
     
  Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up  
  Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up  
  **Touch on yourself**, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit  
  Credit card scam, **get you a Visa**, make it pay your rent  
  **Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches** that be hatin' on you  
  **Pop you a pill**, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you  
  **Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce**  
  It's whatever, just make it count*  

* At the end of “LUST.”, Kendrick references a New Testament Bible passage that speakes directly to the dangers of being controlled by gluttony and lust.  

  * *Lately, in **James 4:4** says  
  "**Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord**"  
  Brace yourself: Lust is all yours*  

* James 4:4 refers to a section of teaching that St. James, the step brother of Jesus, gave to Christians who were getting into conflicts because of their lust, gluttony and desire for all material possession that can be obtained in this world. St. James warns these Christians that living in this way leads to pride (i.e. exalting themselves above other to get what they want). Morover, St. James warns that those who become proud become enemies of God, who opposes those who are proud and gives grace to those who are humble.  

  * ***Where do wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your body parts? You lust, and do not have. You murder and want what someone else has, and can’t obtain it. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires**.
     
  You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that **friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.** Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “**God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble**.
     
  Therefore submit yourself to God. **Resist the devil**, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you inconsistent people. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. **Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.***

#### "The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose" > Graveyard

* By saying "The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose", Kendrick is asserting that those who "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth" are guratneed to be executed alongside the killers who "like taking innocent lives".  
 
* Since their deaths are all but certain, Kendrick cold-heartedly recommends that these people should make plans for their own funeral. Since these people have been so consumed by their own vanity for commercialized products, Kendrick seems to suggest that they should take the time to pick the casket that will allow them to take their vanity to the grave.

* On a few tracks over the years, Kendrick has ointed out the destructive pattern of Black people using credit card scams to illegally get money to pay for their unhealthy consumption habits, addictions or desire to be lazy.  

  * *Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help

#### "They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card" > Chipped

* Getting “chipped” is a slang term for getting killed, particularly by gunshots that are fired to put an end a conflict, as can be heard in several of Kendrick's past tracks.  

  * *I **chip a nigga** lil' bit of nothin'  
  ...  
  **If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed**  
  Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of

  * *Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay  
  **Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway***  
  -"euphoria"  

* In the context of "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick seems to be saying that rappers, influencers and members of the entertainment industry who "glorify scamming" will soon get "chipped" by the people who are carrying out Kendrick's execution orders.

#### "Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit" > Influencers

* Here Kendrick seems to criticizing social media influencers who "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth". These influencers are often followed by thousands or even millions of impressionable young people. Once they amass a significant number of followers, these particular influencers profit from convincing young people that they need to buy sponsored products which may then lead young people to steal money through credit card scams.  
 
* It is worth noting that in the years prior to the release of "Watch the Party Die" several social science research studies published papers which found [connections between materialistic social media content and problematic consumption behavior among young people](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.870614/full).  
 
* To further magnify their influence, these influencers seem to have a pattern of exalting themsevles so that they can "talk down" at people like Kendrick.  

{{< /details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Basic">}}

#### "Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit" > Basic

* In slang usage, the word "basic" is a pejoritive that describes something that is mainsteam, popular and trending or someone who is unrefined and boring because they only like things that are mainsteam, popular and trending.  
 
* For Kendrick "basic shit" from the mainstream entertainment industry seems to be the exact opposite of the thoughful, complex and creative aristry that has defined Kendrick's career, most notably with Kendrick's album, DAMN. winning a [Pulitzer Prize](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kendrick-lamar).  
 
* On the track "Poetic Justice" \(ft. Drake\) from *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, Kendrick highlights how finding someone who is not "basic" is as rare as finding a flower that bloomed in a dark room.  

  * ***I recognize your fragrance**, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh  
  And I know **your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance**, uh  
  **Everybody else basic**, you live life on an everyday basis  
  With poetic justice, poetic justice  
  **If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?***

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Hate">}}

#### "But they don't hate me, they hate the man that I represent" > Hate

* Kendrick claims that he constantly receives hate from "basic" influencers who cannot understand or appreciate Kendrick's thoughtful, complex and creative artistry. However, Kendrick doesn't take this hate personally. From Kendrick's perspective, "basic" influencers hate everything that Kendrick represents in contrast to the mainstream entertainment industry.  

{{< /details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Dickride">}}

#### "The type of man that never dickride 'cause I want a favor" > Dickride

* Within the entertainment industry, Kendrick sees himself as representing the kind of man who never “dickrides.” In slange usage, "dickriding" refers to the act of saying an excessive and unwarrented amount of good thing about an important person in order to benefit by receiving favorable treatment from that important person.  
 
* While the term “dickriding” is most often used metaphorically to describe someone who says an excessive amount of good things to gain favor, the most literal usage of the term refers to a man or woman who willingly receives anal or vaginal sexual penetration from a powerful man in order to receive favorable treatment or economic opportunities.  
 
* It is notable that in the [viral Club Shay Shay interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)](https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&t=6033) Katt Williams highlighted how from the start of his career in the entertainment industry his entire goal was to become successful without ever literally or metaphorically riding anyone’s dick.  

  * ***My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked a penis**. That was my only goal.  
  ...  
  **I've had to turn down $50 million four times** - four times - just **to protect my integrity and that virgin hole** I was telling you about, right. Cause **P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, "No."** You've got to tell him, "No." I did.*  

* While "dickriding" can be a quick way to achieve some level of success, Kendrick seems to see himself as someone who has the patitence needed to reap the rewards hard-earned success.

#### "So where the soldiers at...lost it all and learned to learn from that?" > Soldiers who learned from a loss

* In contrast to men who "dickride" and are "with the basic shit", Kendrick seems to be highlighting the kinds of rare character traits and behaviors that he wants his people to nurture, particularly self improvement, education, hard work, financial stability and a desire or thirst for things that will lead to life.  
 
* These are traits and behaviors that often best developed during childhood and adolescence and thus would be at risk if rappers, infuencers or members of the entertainment industry are allowed to “parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth”.  
 
* More specifically, Kendrick is looking for the rare men who have the mentality of soldiers who lost everything in battle but found a way to learn invaluable life lessons from those losses.  
 
* Within the context of "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick could be looking to recruit these soldiers to be his executioners.  
 
* On “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts” from *Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers*, Kendrick mentioned that the ability to learn from a loss is something that he did not receive from how his own father parented him but it is a blessing that Kendrick want his loved ones to receive  

  * ***Daddy issues made me lеarn losses**, I don't take those well*  
  -"Father Time"  
     
  I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive  
  **I bless it that you can learn from a loss**, I bless it that you heal

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Thirst">}}

#### "a thirst for life, head inside a book 'cause he concerned with that" > Thirst

* Thirst is a concept that Kendrick mentioned on the latter half of the pivotal track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from good kid, m.A.A.d city. On that track, Kendrick described how a life of gluttony led to them to be overcome by a deep spiritual thirst.  

  * ***How many sins**, oh? I'm runnin' out, oh  
  How many sins, oh? I lost count  
  Dreams of ballin' like Spalding  
  But only shotty bounce, oh  
  **The reaper callin'**, oh, **I'm cottonmouth**, oh  
  Money is power (Money is power)  
  Yours is ours (Yours is ours)  
  Lay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh  
  **Hope we get rich**, oh, hope we can tower  
  Over the city with **vanity with the music louder**, oh  
  ...  
  **Too many sins**, oh, I'm runnin' out, oh  
  **Somebody send me a well for the drought**, oh  
  See all I know, oh, is takin' notes  
  On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh  
  My best days, oh, I stress days  
  (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)  
  My best days, oh, I stress days, oh  
  Say "fuck the world", oh, my sex slave, oh  
  **Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?  
  Whatever it is, know it's my next grave**, oh  
  Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'  
  Tired of runnin', oh, tired of tumblin', backwards  
  My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise  
  What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?  
  The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest  
  **You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst  
  So hop in that water, and pray that it works***.  
 
    * On the track “LUST.” from *DAMN.*, Kendrick seems to allude to the experience of "daying of thirst" as he reveals the demonic influence that driving people towards greed, conspicuous consumption, and need for "holy water".  

      * ***I need some water**  
      Something came over me  
      Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat*  

* During a skit at the end of "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst", an older Christian woman sees that Kendrick and his friends were "dying of thirst" because their sadness and anger was driving them towards killing their enemies and putting their own lives at risk. She tells them that their thirst for blood and violence was really a spiritual thirst could only be satisfied by “holy water”, being baptized by the Spirit of the Lord, and receiving a new kind of life from Jesus.  

  * *Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?  
  I know that's not what I think that is  
  Why are you so angry?  
  See, **you young men are dying of thirst**  
  Do you know what that means?  
  **That means you need water, holy water  
  You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord  
  Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?**  
  Okay, repeat after me:  
  "Lord God, I come to You a sinner"  
  "And I humbly repent for my sins"  
  "I believe that Jesus is Lord"  
  "I believe You raised Him from the dead"  
  "**I would ask that Jesus come into my life**"  
  "And be my Lord and Savior"  
  "**I receive Jesus to take control of my life**"  
  "**And that I may live for Him from this day forward**"  
  "Thank you, Lord Jesus  
  For saving me with Your precious blood"  
  "In Jesus' name, amen"  
  Alright now, remember this day  
  **The start of a new life, your REAL life***.  

* The older Christian woman's conclusion that Kendrick and his homies are dying of thirst and need holy water seems to come from scene in St. John's account of the Gospel. In that scene, Jesus stopped to rest in a village inhabitted by people from ethnic group called Samaritans, who were enemies of the the Judean ethnic group to which Jesus belonged. Instead of calling down fire from heaven to burn up the Samaritan village, Jesus started a conversation with a Samaritan woman who was drawing water from a well. Jesus told the woman that he could give her "living water" which would satisfy her to the extent that she would never thirst again.

  * *Jesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.  
     
  So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Judean, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans).  
     
  Jesus replied to her, “**If you knew the gift of God**, and who it is who is saying to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and **He would have given you living water**.”  
     
  She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” Jesus answered and said to her, “**Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.**”*  
     
  -John 4:5,7-14

* Later in St. John's account of the Gospel, as Jesus repeated his offer of "living water" to a crowd of people at a holiday feast, St. John explained that the "living water" which Jesus spoke about was actually the "Holy Spirit". Jesus would give the "Holy Spirit" to his disciples so that his disciples would be filled with new patterns of thoughts and emotions that would empower them to live a new kind of life.  

  * *Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “**If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink**. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost being will **flow rivers of living water**.'”  
     
  This He said in **reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive.***  
     
  -John 7:37-39  
 
* In St. John's account of the Gospel, Jesus told the sister of Jesus's dead friend that “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life \(See [John 11:1-45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&version=NASB)\).  
 
* In that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, "I am the way, the truth and the life” \(See [John 14:2-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&version=NASB)\)
 
* When applied to this line on “Watch the Party Die”, the belief that Jesus is "the life" and the giver of "living water" implies that a “thirst for life” is truly a “thirst for Jesus”. Moreover, those who "thirst for life" discover that Jesus will satisfy their deepest thirst when they read the stories about Jesus in the "Good Book", aka the Holy Bible.

* Kendrick seems to highlight the virtue of individuals who know that they will earn a reward when they do the right thing, which motivates them to read books and get information that will allow them to find out what is right. These individuals stand in contrast to people who "dickride" because they want a favor.

* Kendrick seems to be asserting that the vast majority of men currently have not developed the kind of virtuous traits that behaviors that Kendrick described in the previous lines. As a result, most women who are looking for respectable partners have to put up with immature and soft clowns and nerds who do not know how to behave like real men.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Nipsey Hussle">}}

#### "Would trade all of y'all for Nip, I can't be proud of you niggas" > Nipsey Hussle

* In contrast to rappers who "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth", Kendrick expresses his sadness at the loss of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved South Central rapper who was murdered in March of 2019. Nipsey's murder was particularly tragic because Nispey had shown a remarkable commitment, vision, ingenuity, entreprenership, business accumen and diplomacy in his efforts to improve his local community.  
   
  * Nipsey started a community co-working space named [Vector 90](https://www.thesportspublicist.com/agency/vector-90-x-nispey-hussle) which provided opportunities for Black youth in Crenshaw to take science, technology, engineering and math courses and develop as entrepreneurs.  
     
  * Nipsey was closely involved in the planning and advisory stages of an open air museum called Destination Crenshaw which planned to showcase the history and culture of Black people in his neighborhood.  
     
  * Nipsey arranged meetings between the Los Angeles Police Department to discuss ways to stop gang violence.  
     
  * After Nipsey's death, former president Barack Obama wrote a tribute which said:
  
    * *While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it – to build a skills training center and a coworking space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow – is a legacy worthy of celebration. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it.*

#### "God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace" > Kendrick's prayers

* In contrast to the verses of “Watch the Party Die”, which seem to be persuasive rhetoric addressed to those who will support Kendrick's campaign of vigilante executions, the chorus seems to be a prayer that is addressed to God.  
 
* The idea of praying to God is a recurring motif in Kendrick's work going all the way back to the track "Faith" on Kendrick's first project under the name Kendrick Lamar, the 2009 *Kendrick Lamar EP*.  

  * *I found myself losing focus **at a Sunday service**  
  Embarrassed so **I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"**  
  **He said to live the way he did**, that's all he want from me  
  **Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday**  
  I said alright, **enthused that my Lord gave a listen**  
  **I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian**  
  And this from a person that never believed in religion  
  But shit, my life is so fucked up, man, I can't help but give in*  

* In 2012, Kendrick used his major label debut album, *good kid, m.A.A.d city* to tell the backstory of how he first became a Christian. The album's first track, "Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter", begins with Kendrick and his homies saying a version of the ["Sinners Prayer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinner%27s_prayer) to receive Jesus as there "personal savior". This prayer is later heard within the narrative context during the pivotal moment in "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst" when an older Christian woman approachs Kendrick and his homies and implores them to start a new way of life after Kendrick's friend Dave died in a gang shootout.

  * *Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?  
  I know that's not what I think that is  
  Why are you so angry?  
  See, you young men are dying of thirst  
  Do you know what that means?  
  That means you need water, holy water  
  You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord  
  **Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?**  
  Okay, **repeat after me**:  
  **"Lord God, I come to You a sinner"  
  "And I humbly repent for my sins"**  
  "I believe that Jesus is Lord"  
  "I believe You raised Him from the dead"  
  **"I would ask that Jesus come into my life"  
  "And be my Lord and Savior"**  
  "I receive Jesus to take control of my life"  
  "And that I may live for Him from this day forward"**  
  "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood"  
  "In Jesus' name, amen"  
  Alright now, remember this day  
  **The start of a new life, your REAL life***.  

* On Kendrick's second major label album, *To Pimp a Butterfly*, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of Lucy (aka Lucifer / the devil / the satan / the false accuser / the diabolical one). Lucy acknowledges that Lucy heard Kendrick saying the "Sinner's Prayer" to God the Father on *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, but was nonetheless confident that Kendrick would abandon God and pursue Lucy.  

  * *You said **Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy**  
  ...  
  Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder  
  Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know **you love your Father**  
  **I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album**, truly  
  Lucy don't mind, 'cause **at the end of the day you'll pursue me***  

* On Kendrick's third major label album, *DAMN.*, Kendrick \(or Kung Fu Kenny\) repeatedly expressed feelings of sadness and frustration because he felt that nobody was praying for him. Then during the album's pibotal track, "FEAR.", Kendrick's cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail explaining that Kendrick's feelings of sadness and frustration were not due to a lack of people praying for him but were instead do to Kendrick's own lack of faithfulness in following the Lord's commandments.  

  * *New Kung Fu Kenny  
  **Ain't nobody prayin' for me**  
  ...  
  Bitch, all my grandmas dead  
  So **ain't nobody prayin' for me**, I'm on your head, ayy*  
  -"ELEMENT."
     
  *Shit, I feel like—  
  **Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin'***  
  ...  
  I feel like **the whole world want me to pray for 'em**  
  But **who the fuck prayin' for me?***  
  -"FEEL."
     
  ***Nobody pray for me**  
  It been that day for me*  
  -"HUMBLE."
     
  *What's up, family?  
  Yeah, it's your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man  
  I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately  
  And **I know you feel like, you know  
  People ain't been prayin' for you**  
  But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people.  
  Deuteronomy 28:28 says,  
  "The Lord shall smite thee with madness  
  And blindness, and astonishment of heart"  
  See, family, that's why you feel like you feel  
  Like you got a chip on your shoulder  
  Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...*  
  -"FEAR."

* On Kendrick's fourth major label album, *Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers*, Kendrick seemed to depict himself as being—at least temporarily—distant from God and detached from his identity as a Christian while exploring alternative spiritual practices including praying to flowers and trees.

  * *Yesterday, **I prayed to the flowers and trees**  
  Gratification to the powers that be  
  ...  
  The **noble person that** goes to work and **pray like they 'posed to**  
  Slaughter people too**, your murder's just a bit slower*  
  -"Worldwide Steppers"
     
  *Where's my faith? **Told you I was Christian, but just not today**  
  I transformed, **prayin' to the trees**, God is taking shape  
  ...  
  I **pray our children don't inherit me** and feelings I attract*

* On Kendrick's first battle track, "euphoria", Kendrick implied that Drake was an absentee father while rapping about the role as a father, including responsibility of teaching one's son to pray.  

  * *Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?  
  That's ho shit, **I got a son to raise**, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that  
  Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that  
  **Then tell him to pray**, know nothin' 'bout that  
  Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that  
  Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that  
  **Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin'**, you don't know nothin' 'bout that*  

* On Kendrick's second battle record, "6:16 in LA", Kendrick spoke directly to God while seemingly confessing that he was engaging in the battle with Drake in part because his identity is wrapped up in being a solider who needs to go to war in order to have a stable identity.  

  * *Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom  
  **God**, ah, my confession is yours  
  But, **who am I if I don't go to war?***

#### "God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace" > The Lord's Prayer

* The idea of a perosn praying for God to give them what they truly need is one of the central points of the most famous and univeral Christian prayer, which is known as the "Lord's Prayer". Thos who pray the Lord's Prayer asks for God the Father to give them their "daily bread" in referrence to the essential physical and spiritual need on a daily basis in order to live.  

  * ***Our Father**, who is in heaven,  
  hallowed be Your name.  
  Your Kingdom come.  
  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  
  **Give us today our daily bread**,  
  and forgive us our tresspasses,  
  as we forgive those who trespass against us,  
  and lead us not into temptation,  
  but deliver us from the evil one.*   

* The idea of "bread" being symbolic for the things that someone needs to live is further explored in a story where Jesus multiplies five loves of bread in order to feed five thousand men and their families \(See [Matthew 14:13-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A13-21&version=NASB) or [John 6:1-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A1-15&version=NASB)\).  
 
* Later, after a crowd of those who ate the multiplied bread started to focus exclusively on their desire for Jesus to fulfill their physical hunger for physical bread, Jesus told the crowd that he himself is the spiritual "bread of life" and that anyone who eats Jesus as the "bread of life" will live forever.

  * *Jesus said to them, “**I am the bread of life**; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. For **this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life**, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day. **I am the bread of life**. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that **anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh**. Truly, truly, I say to you, **unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life**, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, **the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.***  
  -Matthew 6:35,40,48-58

* Later, just before Jesus was arrrested and executed on a cross, he shared a meal of bread and wine his disciples and told them that the bread was his body and the wine was his blood. This particular meal of Jesus's disciplles eating bread as Jesus's body and drinking wine as Jesus's blood became a the most central Christian spiritual practice known as the "communion", the "Eucharist" or the "Lord's Supper".   

  * ***Jesus took some bread**, and after a blessing, He broke it and **gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body.”** nd when He had taken **a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the \[covenant / agreement\]**, which is being poured out **for many for forgiveness of sins**.*  

* Hence, if we see Kendrick's prayer during the chorus of "Watch the Party Die" as an echo of the Lord's Prayer, we could conclude that what Kendrick truly needs to receive is Jesus himself and the new way of life that comes from living in close communion with Jesus. This is the same conclusion that was presented to Kendrick when the older Christian woman convinced Kendrick and his homies not to kill their enemies and instead led them to say the "Sinner's Prayer" at the end of "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst."  

  * *"**I would ask that Jesus come into my life**"  
  "And **be my Lord** and Savior"  
  "**I receive Jesus to take control of my life**"  
  "And **that I may live for Him** from this day forward"  
  "Thank you, Lord Jesus for **saving me with Your precious blood**"  
  "In Jesus' name, amen"  
  Alright now, remember this day  
  **The start of a new life, your REAL life***.

#### "God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace" > God-given life

* In addition to referring to himself as the "bread of life", Jesus also describes himself as "the life" on a few other occasions in St. John's account of the Gospel.  

  * After one of Jesus's friends died, Jesus told the sister of the friend, “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life \(See [John 11:1-45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&version=NASB)\).  
     
  * In that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, "I am the way, the truth and the life” \(See [John 14:2-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&version=NASB)\)  

* Throughout St. John's account of the Gospel, Jesus repeatedly teaches that he came to earth not to kill or destroy humans but to give "eternal life" to all those who would listen to his teaching and believed in him.  

  * *The Son of Man be lifted up, so that **everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him**. For **God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life**. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.*  
  -John 3:14-17  
     
  ***The one who believes in the Son has eternal life**; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life.*  
  -John 3:36  
     
  *Jesus answered and said to the Samaritan woman, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but **the water that I will give him will become** in him **a fountain of water springing up to eternal life**.”*  
  -John 4:13-14  
     
  The one who reaps is receiving wages and is **gathering fruit for eternal life**.*  
  -John 4:36  
     
  *Truly, truly, I say to you, **the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life**, and does not come into judgment, but has **passed out of death into life**.*  
  -John 5:24  
     
  ***You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life**; and **it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me**; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.*  
  -John 5:39-40  
     
  *Do not work for the food that perishes, but **work for the **food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you**.*  
  -John 6:27  
     
  *For **this is the will of My Father**, that **everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life**, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.*  
  -John 6:40  
     
  *Truly, truly, I say to you, **the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.** Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that **anyone may eat from it and not die**. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; **if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever**; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.*  
  -John 6:47-51  
     
  *Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. **The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life**, and I will raise him up on the last day.*  
  -John 6:53-54  
     
  ***My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish**; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.*  
  -John 10:27-28  
     
  *The one who loves his life loses it, and **the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life**.*  
  -John 12:25  
     
  *The Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. And **I know that His commandment is eternal life***.  
  -John 12:49-50  

* All of these teachings about "eternal life" lead up to a culminating prayer in which Jesus talks directly to God the Father and declares that "eternal life" is the experience of knowing God the Father and Jesus as the Son of God in a close relationship.  

  * ***Jesus spoke** these things; and **raising His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father**, the hour has come; glorify **Your Son**, so that the Son may glorify You, just as You gave Him authority over all humanity, so that to all whom You have given Him, He **may give eternal life. this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ** whom You have sent.*  
  -John 17:1-3  

* Hence, when Kendrick prays "God, give me life", Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is life. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus's teachings about love and forgivness so that Kendrick can judge and execute the very same people who Jesus came to offer eternal life.  

{{< /details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="God-given peace">}}

#### "God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace" > God-given peace

* Just before he was arrested and executed, Jesus gave one final teaching to his disciples. In that final teaching, Jesus said that he was giving "peace" to his disciples. Moreover, Jesus clarified that that he himself is the peace that he was giving to his disciples. The disciples would receive this peace by listening to Jesus' words and remaining in close relationship with Jesus.  

  * ***Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you**; not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. These things I have spoken to you so that **in Me you may have peace**. In the world you have oppression, but be of good courage for I have overcome the world.*  
  -John 14:27, 16:33  

* Also, in Jesus's most famous collection of teachings, he declared that his disciples will be blessed with a close relationship to God the Father when they serve as peacemakers in the world.  

  * **Blessed are the peacemakers**, for they **will be called children of God**.
  -Matthew 5:9

* Hence, when Kendrick prays "dear God, please give me peace", Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is peace. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus's teachings about being a peacemaker so that Kendrick can try to overcome the evils of the world through violence.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Keep away from me">}}

#### "Dear God, please keep these lame niggas away from me'" > Keep away from me

* In slang, the word "lame" refers to anything that is not cool, refined or worthy of honor.  

* Kendrick's prayer to keep "these lame niggas away" seems to echo the end of the Lord's Prayer which asks God the Father to lead his people away from tempting situations and away from the "evil one" in reference to the \[devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one\].

  * ***Lead us not into temptation**, but **deliver us from the evil one.***  

* By praying to "keep these lame niggas away from me" Kendrick seems to be asserting that these "lame niggas" members of "the other side" which is opposed to "God's side". If Kendrick was to follow the example of Jesus and the early praying to transform these "lame niggas" so that they could repent, apologize and come to "God's side".

{{< details is_markdown="false" nest_level="0" is_lyric="true" title="Dear God, keep me shinin'" >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Shining">}}

#### "Dear God, keep me shinin'" > Shining

* In hip hop terminology, “shining” refers to wearing gaudy amounts of expensive, shiny diamond jewelry or otherwise making public displays of one's success, wealth and power.  
 
* Given that Kendrick earlier expressed his desire to kill rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth”, it is likely that Kendrick is not asking God to give him shiny jewelry.  
 
* Similar to the previous requests for life and peace, it seems more likely that Kendrick is making a request for spiritual well-being rather than material or financial well-being.  
 
* In biblical terminology “shining” refers to the way in which people who follow God's commandments serve as bright example of how other humans should live.  
 
* In the introduction to St. John's account of the Gospel, St. John introduces Jesus by saying that Jesus is the "true light" who has existed even before the universe was created. Moreover, St. John asserts through Jesus's birth as a human, the "light" has now come down from the skies to "shine" on humans and penetrate through the darkness of human wickedness.  

  * *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and **the life was the light of humanity. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it…the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world***  

* Later in St. John's account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a crowd of listeners that he is the "light of the world" that humans can follow so that they find the light of life and no longer walk towards the darkness of death.

  * *Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “**I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life**.”*  
  -John 8:12  

* In addition to identifying himself as the "light of the word", in St. Matthew's account of the Gospel, Jesus also taught his disciples that they are the "light of the world" who are meant to "shine" the light of Jesus's way of life so that people in the world no longer have to walk towards the darkness of death.  

  * ***You all are the light of the world**. A city located on a hill can't be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bucket, but on a lampstand; so it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, **let your light shine before humans, so that they may see your good actions and glorify your Father who is in heaven**.*  
  -Matthew 6:14-16

* By teaching that humans who are faithful to God will shine spiritual light to indicate how other humans should live, Jesus seems to be referring to a Old Testament prophesy from the Prophet Daniel.  

  * *Many of those who sleep \(i.e. are dead\) in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt. **Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the sky. Those who turn many toward right relationship will shine as the stars forever and ever.***  
  -Daniel 12:2-3  

* Hence, by praying "Dear God, keep me shinin'", Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is light. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus's teachings about being a "light to the world" by being an example to those who are living in darkness and giving them an opportunity to turn towards right relationships with other humans. Rather than turning wicked people toward the light of life, Kendrick keeps expressing his desire to bring the darkness of death upon the hosts and attendees of the party.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Police">}}

#### "Pocket-watching, you must be the police" > Police

* Kendrick's prayer to God seems to be interrupted as he wonders what the “lame niggas" who thinking about Kendrick. Kendrick seems to conclude that that the "lame niggas" are thinking that Kendrick is acting like a police officer who is "pocket-watching" them.  
 
* "Pocket-watching" refers to the act of closely monitoring what another person is doing—particularly regarding their use of money—so that monitoring person can make some kind of judgement or assessment of the other person.  
 
* Within hip hop culture, rappers, hustlers and "steet niggas" often describe an adversarial relationship with the police, most famously on the legendary rap group NWA's hit single "Fuck tha Police."  
 
* By saying that Kendrick "must be the police", the "lame niggas" seem to be expressing some amount of nervousness that they might be caught, prosecuted, and judged for any illicit actions that they might have committed at "the party".  
 
* The idea that Kendrick “must be the police” would also align with the battle track “meet the grahams”, where Kendrick claimed to be "policing" the "weird shit" going on in the entertainment industry after he dropped the bombshell allegation that Drake and his OVO crew have allegedly been sex trafficking under aged girls.  

  * *Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen  
  Mm-mm, **your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die**  
  **Him and Weinstein** should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life  
  He hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish  
  Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better  
  **He got sex offenders on ho-VO** that he keep on a monthly allowance  
  A child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them  
  And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' **there's predators like him lurkin'**  
  Fuck a rap battle, **he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose**  
  **I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret**  
  It's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it**  
  They be **streamlinin' victims all inside of they home** and callin' 'em tender  
  Then **leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas***

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Bless">}}

#### "God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think" > Bless

* After wondering what the "lame niggas" were thinking about him, Kendrick goes back to praying to God. He now asks for God to "bless" the words that he is rapping and the words that he is thinking.  
 
* In biblical terminology a "blessing" refers to God giving preferential favor to a people, places, objects or things so that they may bring about more life and goodness on the earth.  
 
* In the very first narrative of the Bible, God gave a blessing to animals and then humans so that they would reproduce new life that fill the earth.

  * ***God created** the great sea creatures and **every living creature** that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. **God blessed them**, saying, “**Be fruitful and multiply**, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”  
     
  **God created humanity** in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. **God blessed them**; and God said to them, “**Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth**, and subdue it; and **rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth**.”*
  -Genesis 1:21-23,27-28  

* However, when humans are tempted by a devil in the form of a snake and disobey God's commandment by trying to define good and evil for themselves, their actions result in curse which leads to death and evil on the earth.  

  * *Then the LORD **God said to the snake**,  
     
  “Because you have done this,  
  **Cursed are you** more than all the livestock,  
  And more than any animal of the field;  
  On your belly you shall go,  
  And **you shall eat dust  
  All the days of your life**;  
     
  Then the LORD **God said to the human**, “**Because you** have listened to the voice of your wife, and **have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'**:  
     
  **Cursed is the ground because of you**;  
  With hard labor you shall eat from it  
  All the days of your life.  
  **It will grow both thorns and thistles** for you;  
  Yet you shall eat the plants of the field;  
  By the sweat of your face  
  You shall eat bread,  
  **Until you return to the ground**,  
  Because from it you were taken;  
  For you are dust,  
  And **to dust you shall return**.”*
  -Genesis 3:14,17-19

* The story of humanity receiving a blessing or a curse depending on whether they obey or disobey God's commandments is a recurring biblical motif that gets further developed in the Book of Deuteronomy when the Prophet Moses gives a speech to the Israelites before they go into the "Promised Land" which God had prepared for them. Moses repeatedly told the Israelites that God was offering them a choice between life and death, between a blessing and a curse.  

  * **If you diligently obey the Lord your God**, being careful to **do all His commandments** which I am commanding you today, that the Lord your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And **all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God**:
     
  **Blessed** will you be in the city, and **blessed** will you be in the country.  
  **Blessed** will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock.  
  **Blessed** will be your basket and your kneading bowl.  
  **Blessed** will you be when you come in, and **blessed** will you be when you go out.  
     
  But it shall come about, **if you do not obey the Lord your God, to be careful to follow all His commandments** and His rules which I am commanding you today, that all **these curses will come upon you** and overtake you.  
     
  **Cursed** will you be in the city, and **cursed** will you be in the country.  
  **Cursed** will be your basket and your kneading bowl.  
  **Cursed** will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, the newborn of your herd, and the offspring of your flock.  
  **Cursed** will you be when you come in, and **cursed** will you be when you go out.  
     
  The LORD shall smite you with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.  
     
  I have **placed before you today life and good and also death and evil**. For I command you today to **love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments**, his rules, and his justice, **that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you**. I have **placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse**. Therefore **choose life, that you may live, you and your seed**, to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; **for he is your life**, and the length of your days.  
     
  -Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19,28 30:15-16,19-20  

* In the New Testament, Jesus and his chosen disciples commanded followers of Jesus love and bless their enemies and not to hate and curse them.

  * *Jesus taught them saying, “You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, **love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven**; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.*  
  -Matthew 5:43-45
     
  ***Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse***.  
  -St. Paul's Letter to the Romans 12:14

* Given that throughout the verses of "Watch the Party Die" Kendrick has used his words to call for the execution of the hosts and attendees of "the party" and has been ignoring Jesus's commandments to love his enemies and bless those who have persecuted him, it is ironic that Kendrick is now praying for God to "bless his words" and "bless how he think."

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="DAMN.">}}

#### "God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think" > DAMN.

* It is notable that the title for Kendrick's album, *DAMN.*, is shortening of the word "damnation" which is a synonym for "curse." and the oppostive of a "blessing".  
 
* "BLOOD." the first track on *DAMN.* opens a voice that presents a choice between life and death, similar to the choice that the Prophet Moses placed in front of the Israelites.  

  * *Is it wickedness?  
  Is it weakness?  
  **You decide.  
  Are we gonna live or die**?*  

* On "YAH." the third track on *DAMN.*, Kendrick identifies himself as an Israelite and refers to a conversation in which his cousin Carl Duckworth told him that he was "cursed" based on Moses's speech from Deuteronomy about blessings and curses.  

  * ***I'm a Israelite**, don't call me black no mo'  
  That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'  
  My cousin called, **my cousin Carl Duckworth  
  Said** know my worth  
  And **Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed***  

* On "FEAR." the pivotal track on *DAMN.*, we hear a voicemail in which Kendrick's cousin Carl Duckworth quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and asserts that Kendrick is experiencing a cursed existence because he has not been following God's commandments.  

  * *What's up, family?  
  Yeah, it's **your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call**, man  
  I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately  
  And I know you feel like, you know  
  People ain't been prayin' for you  
  But you have to understand this, man, that **we are a cursed people**  
  **Deuteronomy 28:28 says,  
  "The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart"**  
  See, family, **that's why you feel like you feel**  
  Like you got a chip on your shoulder  
  **Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...**  
  ...  
  Verse 2 says,  
  "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,  
  therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"  
  So **until we come back to these commandments  
  Until you come back to these commandments  
  We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse**  
  Because He said He's gonna punish us  
  The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians  
  Are the true children of Israel  
  **We are the Israelites, according to the Bible**  
  The children of Israel  
  **He's gonna punish us** for our iniquities, **for our disobedience**  
  Because we chose to follow other gods  
  That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee  
  So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you  
  **Because He loves you**, so that's why we get chastised  
  That's why we're in the position that we're in  
  **Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments  
  And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us**  
  We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live  
  Here, in today, in the United States of America  
  I love you, family, and I pray for you  
  God bless you  
  Shalom*

#### "Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me" > Drawing the line in the Old Testament

* Kendrick seems to be asking God to make a distinction between himself and the “lame niggas" who Kendrick wants God to keep away from him.  
 
* Kendrick seems to be requesting something that is similar to what God did when he rescured the Israelites from slavery.  
 
* Prior to being resuced the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptian Pharaoh, who forced the Israelites to live in slave houses in a region near the capital of Egypt. When Pharaoah worried that the Israelite population was becoming too large, Pharaoh sent orders for soldier to kill every baby boy that was born to an Israelite mother.  
 
* God saved one Israelite boy named Moses and later called Moses to be a prophet. God then sent Moses to confront Pharaoh by telling him to let the Israelites go free. When Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God used Moses to send plagues ten different plagues which brough death and destruction upon Egypt.  
 
* After the first nine plagues, God said that he was going to send a final tenth plague in which a spirit of death would pass through the capital of Egypt and the neighboring regions. This spirit of death would kill the first born sons and male animals of every household as a punishment for Pharaoh and the Egyptians killing the Israelties newborn sons.  
 
* Since this plague of death was going to pass through the region of the Israelite slave houses, God told the Israelites that their sons and male animals would be spared for each Israelite houshold that celebrated a Passover (aka Pesach / Pascha) ritual meal. During the Passover meal, each Israelite family would kill a lamb, smear the blood on the posts and crossbar of their exterior door, and eat the lamb meat with unleavened bread. When the death spirit came across a door covered in lamb's blood it would “pass over” the house without killing the firstborn son or male animals.  
 
* God told Moses that by bringing death to the firstborn sons of Egypt while providing a way preserve the lives of the sons of Israel, God was created a line of separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites.  

  * There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, **that you may know that the LORD makes a line of separation* between the Egyptians and Israel.  
  -Exodus 11:6-7  

* Hence, by praying "Dear God, draw the line" and prevent anyone from confusing Kendrick with the "lame niggas", Kendrick seems to be asking God to kill the “lame niggas" similar to how God sent the spirit of death to killsthe sons of the Egyptian who liked taking the innocent lives of the Israelites in the Old Testament.

#### "Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me" > Drawing the line in the New Testament

* In the New Testament, the are several instances where Jesus does speak a future day where he will separate the righteous from the wicked.  
 
* In St. Matthew's account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about a land owner who instructs his servants to plant wheat seeds in a field. However, after the servants plant the wheat seeds, a deceptive adversary—who represents the \[devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one\]—comes at night to plant seeds which will grow into weeds that look like wheat but do not produce any grain (See [Matthew 13:24-30,36-43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A24-30%2C36-43&version=NASB)).  
     
  * When the wheat and the weeds begin to sprout up, the servants discover that someone has planted weeds among the wheat. The servants initially want to pull out all the weeds from the field. However, the land owner stops them.  
     
  * The land owner tells the servants that because the wheat and the weeds look very similar at this stage of their development, if the servants try to pull up the weeds they may accidentally pull up some of the wheat thinking that they are weeds. Moreover, since the wheat and the weeds are planted so close together, even if they can accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds, pulling up the weeds may uproot the wheat.  
     
  * The land owner tells the servants that it is not yet time to pull up the weeds. Instead, the land owner tells the servants to wait until the time of the harvest when all of the wehat has had the chance to be fruitful and produce grain. At that point, the servants will be able to accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds. The servants will then gather the wheat together and burn up the weeds to dispose of them.  
     
  * Jesus explains that this parable is a metaphor for the "Last Judgment" at end of the world as we know it, when those who have lived lives with right relationships will be gathered together in God's new creation while the wicked are exclused from God's new creation.  

* Within the context of "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick seems to be a kind of disobedient servant who refuses to listen to the land owner's instructions and is convinced that now is the time to pull out the weeds. If he continues to disobey the land owenrs instruction, Kendrick will end up destroying the lives of the those who will eventually produce good grain.  
   
* It is particularly ironic that in the first verse Kendrick described himself as a "the man that resides in patience" but by saying "I think it's time to watch the party die" Kendrick seems to be too impatient to wait for the time that the Lord has set to bring an end to wickedness.  
 
* Later in St. Matthew's account of the Gospel, Jesus tells another parable about the "Last Judgement" in which the Lord will be like a herder who takes a mixed herd of sheep and goats into the pastures. However, at the end of the day, the herder separates the sheep from the goats and places the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.  
     
  * Jesus explains that the sheep represent people who have maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need. In contrast, the goats represents people who have not maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need.  
     
  * In the parable, many of the people who turn out to be sheep are not aware that they did anything in thier lives that would cause them to be included among the sheep. Similarly, many of the people who turn out to be goats are not aware that they failed to do things that would have allowed them to be included among the sheep.  
     
  * The fact that the identity of the sheep and the goats is a surprise that is not revealed until the end of time as we know seems to suggest that all humans should not be quick to assume that someone else is a goat or assume that they themselves are sheep.  

* Within the context of "Watch the Party Die", seems to be convinced that he is one of the sheep. However, by advocating to burn down entire villages and ignoring Jesus's commandments to love his neighbor, Kendrick is acting more like a goat who has failed to maintain right relationships.

#### "Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried" > Forgiveness in the New Testament

* Kendrick's final request is for God to grant him forgiveness. In case God might not be included to forgive kendrick, Kendrick tried to justify himself by pointing out how hard he has tried to do what's right.  
 
* The request for God's forgviness echos the Lord's Prayer, which includes the following request:

  * ***Forgive us** our transgressions (i.e. violations of trust)  
  **as we forgive** those who transgress against us (i.e. violate our trust)*  

* After teaching his disciples the Lord's Prayer, Jesus specifically highlighted the request for forgiveness by making it clear that God would not forgive those who refuse to forgive others.  

  * ***If you forgive** humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], **your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive** humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], **your Father will also not forgive your [transgressions / violations of trust]**.*  
  -Matthew 6:14-15

* Later on in St. Matthew's account of the Gospel, one of Jesus's disciples asked how many times he should forgive a brother who has sdone something wrong to him. In response, Jesus told his disciples a parable which reflected on the for necessity for God's people to forgive other humans because God has already forgiven his people to a much greater degree \(See [Matthew 18:21-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A21-35&version=NASB)\).  
     
  * In this parable there is a king—representing God the Father—who has many servants—representing different humans, particularly followers of Jesus.  
     
  * One of these servants has somehow borrowed large amounts of money from the king and now owes the king what in today's currency would be equivalent to $8 billion dollars.  
     
  * When the king realizes how much money the servant owes him, the king announced plans to sell the servant into slavery along with the servant's wife and children in order to at least recuperate some money.  
     
  * The servant then falls on the ground and begs the king not to sell him into slavery. He even tells the king that he will repay the equivalent of $8 billion dollar that he owes.  
     
  * The king has compassion on the servant, releases him from his impending slavery and forgives all of the servants debts.  
     
  * However, immediately after having his debts forgiven, the first servant walks out of kings court and sees a second servant who owes the first servant what would be the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars.  
     
  * The first servant immedateily grabs the second servant by the neck, begins choking him and demands that the second servant pay him back.  
     
  * The second servant then falls on the ground and begs the first servant servant to be patient and he will repay the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars that he owes.  
     
  * However, the first servant refuses to forgive the second servant. Instead, the first servant throws the second servant into a debtors prison where the second servant will be forced for work for three or more months in order to pay the first servant back.  
     
  * Soon the king finds out what the first servant did to the second servant and calls the first servant back to his court. The king becomes angry with the first servant and strongly condemns him for refusing to forgive a $14 thousand dollar debt after the king had forgiven him much, much larger $8 billion dollar debt.  
     
  * The king then once again holds the first servant responsible for the $8 billion dollar debt. The king orders the first servant to be thrown into debtors prison until he has repaid the entire debt. This punishment is essentially a life sentence because it would take 164 thousand years of labor for the first servant to pay the king back.  

* Based on the Jesus's teaching on the Lord's Prayer and the parable of the unforgiving servant, it is deeply ironic that Kendrick is praying "Dear God, please forgive me" after he has refused to forgive Drake or anyone who has participated in "the party" and has even claimed "this shit done got too wicked to apologize."  
 
* Moreover, based on Jesus's teaching, Kendrick's self-justification that God knows "how hard I tried" seems destined to fall on deaf ears and be rejected by God. Jesus dicussed how he would reject the pleas of individuls who claimed to do lots of things for God but refused to actually does God the Father.  

  * *Jesus taught his disciple saying, "**Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Fathe**r who is in heaven will enter. **Many will say to Me** on that day,  
     
  'Lord, Lord, **did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?**'  
     
  And then **I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; leave Me, you who act against the law.**'"*  
     
  -Matthew 7:21-23

#### "Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried" > Forgiveness in Kendrick's cataloge.

* The need forgivness is a central theme within both *DAMN.* and *Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers*.

* On “DNA.”, the second track of DAMN., Kendrick rapped about the fact his rough upbringing taught him so many things he needed to know to become successful in the would, but the one things that he wish he had received was to be nurtured in a way that would allow him to forgive others.  

  * *I know murder, conviction  
  Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption  
  Scholars, fathers dead with kids and  
  **I wish I was fed forgiveness**  
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA*

* The theme of monetary debts in the parable of the unforgiving servant also reminds us of the track “XXX.” from *DAMN.*, where Kendrick tells a story about his friend's son who was killed because of “insufficient funds”. When the friend called Kendrick and asked for spiritual guidance from an anointed Chrisitan, Kendrick ignores Jesus's teachings by saying that he would never forgive someone who harmed any one of his family members and the friend should not forgive either.

  * *Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101  
  Said **they killed his only son because of insufficient funds**  
  ...  
  He said, "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me  
  **I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome**"  
  He was lookin' for some closure, **hopin' I could bring him closer  
  To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him**  
  "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel  
  **If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed**  
  Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of  
  All the memories collected, moments you could never touch  
  I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block  
  I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got  
  **I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap**  
  Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that"  
  ...  
  **Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman  
  Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother  
  You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap***  

* In the first verse of “Mother I Sober” from *Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers*, Kendrick acknowledged his battles with sex addiction, infidelity, and violations of trust in his relationships with Whitney, his fiance and the mother of his children. As he reckoned with the pain that he had caused to an innocent soul, Kendrick asked God whether he could be forgiven for what he had done.  

  * *Intoxicated, **there's a lustful nature** that I failed to mention  
  Insecurities that I project, **sleepin' with other women**  
  **Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know**, I found her in the kitchen  
  **Askin' God**, "Where did I lose myself? And **can it be forgiven?**"  
  Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, **"Is there an addiction?"**  
  I said "No," but this time **I lied**, I knew that I can't fix it  
  **Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me**  
  Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy*  

* The theme of forgivness is noticably been absent within the diss tracks that Kendrick released during his battle with Drake. Here in "Watch the Party Die" Kendrick seems to fully reject the idea of forgiving anyone even as he prays for God to forgive him.

#### "Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried" > Forgiveness in Kendrick's cataloge.

* I do think it is important to point out that within the context of Bible, forgiveness does not mean that society, law enforcement or victims should allow a crime to go unpunished or—even worse—allow a perpetrator to continue harming the victim or other future victims.  

* This point is actually illustrated quite clearly by the Old Testament story of King David using his power to traffic a woman to his palace, force her to have sex with him, and then kill her husband to cover up a pregnancy. In that case, God sent a prophet to directly confront David about his evil and unjust actions. David admitted to being guilty under God's judgment, repented, was forgiven by God, and was spared from the death penalty. However, David's actions had real world consequences that led to the deaths of at least three of David's sons as well as a significant amount of societal shame which over time made countless numbers of men in David's time—along with later readers of the Bible—think twice about allowing uncontrolled sexual desire to lead them to coercing women or murdering people to cover up earlier acts of wickedness.  

* One can also look at the New Testament story from St. John account of the Gospel in which a woman who was caught while she was having sex in an adulterous relationship. Unlike the case of the woman with King David, she had apparently chosen to engage in this sexual relationship. She was then brought in front of an all-male court of Judean religious leaders who appealed to Jesus to serve as a trial judge who would sentence her to death under the rules laid out in laws given to Moses \(See [John 8:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A1-11&version=NASB)\).  
     
  * Jesus sent all the accusers away by pointing out that they had themselves done things against the law of Moses that the Israelites were supposed to follow and thus should not feel that it was their right to condemn the woman to the death penalty.  
     
  * Jesus had not done any actions that broke the law of Moses, so he theoretically had the right to condemn the woman to the death penalty. However, he chose not to. Instead, Jesus told the woman, "I do not condemn you. Go on your way. From now on, do not sin any more.”  
     
  * In this case, Jesus let the woman go free without any additional punishment beyond the societal shame that she had already experienced and would likely continue to experience. Jesus didn't totally take this consequence away, though he did mitigate it to some degree by pointing out the lawless actions of her accusers.  
     
  * Moreover, Jesus warned her by saying “do not sin any more”. This statement echos a previous statement from Jesus after Jesus healed a man and told that man “Now you have become well. Do not sin anymore or something worse will happen to you”.  
     
  * Hence, Jesus ultimate goal was for the woman not be immediatly killed for her wickedness but for her to find healing and be transformed in a way that she would be able to stop herself from acting in a way that would ruin her relationships and result in a negative final judgement at the end of time.

* After praying to God throughout most of the chorus, Kendrick ends the chorus by doubling down on the first line of the first verse. Kendrick further emphasizes his desire to execute the hosts and attendees of the party by saying "watch the party die" three times and adding the phrases "send 'em home" and "get'em gone", which are both slang phrases for killing someone.

* Kendrick begins the second verse with the same line from beginning of the first verse. Additionally, the chorus ended with Kendrick saying "watch the party die" three times.

#### "Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies" > Street niggas

* Kendrick seems to be highlighting more people who should be executed for the benefit of society.  
 
* “Street niggas" refer to young Black men who are engaged in selling drugs, hustling, robberies, gang banging or any other kind of illegal activity that is done to get money. These kinds of activities are statistically more common in densely populated, urbanized neighborhoods in major American cities where people are more likely to walk through the city on street sidewalks in contrast to American suburbs where many people exclusively drive from one place to another.  
 
* The illegal activities in which "street niggas" often engage often lead to violence, murder and other casualties as Kendrick has detailed throughout much of his work, such as the track “Poe Man's Dreams” from *Section.80*.  

  * My mama is stressin', my daddy tired  
  **I need me a weapon**, these niggas ride  
  Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me  
  How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?  
  Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts  
  My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink  
  You like to mistake a **street nigga** for real nigga  
  The **same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you**  

* Since “street niggas" typically depict themselves as people who like to kill others, they would likely be included among the peaople who Kendrick planned to execute when he said "We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives."

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Corporate guys">}}

#### "Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies" > Corporate guys

* "Corporate guys" likely refers to the entertainment industry's corporate employees who are paid to find ways of making money from music, films and other forms of entertainment. In many cases, their approach to making money is not in the best interest of the artist who makes the work, the audience who consumes the work, or the society in which the work is distibuted.  
 
* In the case that "corporate guys" are trying to make money from the stories of "street niggas", the resulting work may actually lead the audience to immitate behavior that leads some individuals to kill other individuals.  
 
* Within both *DAMN.* and *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Kendrick has pointed out that corporate employees often hide their tendency to be killers and murderers while teaching their own deceptive philosophies to the youth.  

  * ***It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street  
  Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with  
  Homicidal thoughts***  
  -"XXX."  
     
  *The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run  
  The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage,  
  *the market is crashin', the industry wants  
  Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box  
  while they makin' a mockery followin' us**  
  **This ain't Monopoly**, watchin' for love.  
  **This ain't monogamy. Y'all gettin' fucked***  
  -"N95"  
     
  ***I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer**, bitch  
  **We some killers**, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch

  Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)  
  **Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies**  
  You either gon' be dead or in jail, **killer psychology**  
  **Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?***  
  -"Worldwide Steppers"

* "Corporate guys" may thus be complicit with those who "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth" and for whom "the graveyard is company".

#### "Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies" > Rappers that report the lies

* Rather than "givin' truth to the youth", "corporate guys" often appropriate the stories from "street niggas" and package them in music made by "rappers that report the lies".  
 
* On "N95." from *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Kendrick seemed to expose liars in the rap game and demand that they take off their lies like an actor taking off a mask.  

  * *You're back outside, but **they still lied**  
  ...  
  Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi  
  Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, **take off the flex and the white lies**  
  Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five  
  **Take off them fabricated streams** and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside  
  (Take that shit off)*  

* It's also notable that in the battle tracks, Kendrick repeatedly called Drake a liar, actor, and manipulator who has tried to borrow stories and credibility from "street niggas".  

  * *The **famous actor** we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'

  -"Not Like Us"  

* Kendrick expressed his hatred for all street niggas, corporate guys, rappers and members of the entertainment industry who have empowered, emboldened and enabled Drake.  

  * ***Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too***

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Families moritifed">}}

#### "I need they families mortified" > Families mortified

* In addition to ordering the execution of the "street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies", Kendrick says that he "needs" the families of these individuals to be “mortified”. The word "mortified" refers to someone feeling ashamed, particularly when they are in the view of the public.  
 
* It is notable that in early forms of English—from the 1300s to the 1700s—the word “moritiy” meant “to kill”. The word was originally derived from the Latin word “mortificō” which literally meant “to put to death”. In early forms of English, "mortify" was often used metaphorically to refer to the act of subduing, humbling, or humiliating someone.  
 
* By using the word mortify, Kendrick subtly brings up the idea that the family of the street niggas, corporate guys, and lying rappers should also be killed. The idea of killing family members of excessively wicked individuals connects back to first verse where Kendrick told his supporters to “burn the whole village”.

#### "We can do life without 'em. Get they bodies organized." > Execution orders

* Coming after the previous lines, Kendrick again seems to be assuring his supporters that it is okay to kill the street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies"along with their family members because society will go on just fine without them being alive.  
 
* Kendrick then seems to appeal to his supporters to join his roster of executioners and help in the process of organizing the dead bodies after carrying out the execution orders.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Pillow-talking">}}

#### "No more pillow-talkin', jump-startin' neighborhood wars" > Pillow-talking

* "Pillow-talking" refers to conversations that happen between couples while lying down in bed with their heads on pillows after having sex.  
 
* Certain hip hop media figures, such as [DJ Akademics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXtyIYSPadY&t=596s), have explained that arguments, hatred and information that is leveraged within rap battle often spreads because many rappers will often have sex with the same set of women. These women end up pillow-talking about the other rappers with whom they have had sex.  
 
  * DJ Akademics—who is sometimes referred to as Ak'—is also known for being a loyal supporter of Drake. Kendrick previously suggested that DJ Akademics is compromised on “6:16 in LA”.
  
    * *Yeah, somebody's lyin', **I can see the vibes on Ak'  
    Even he lookin' compromised**, let's peel the layers back*  

* The pillow-talking dynamic also exist among violent street niggas, which explains how pillow-talking could lead to neighborhood wars.  
 
* By saying "no more pillow-talkin'", Kendrick seems to be implying that he will be giving orders to execute the "dirty-macking bitches" who have attended "the party" or had sex with the street niggas, corporate guys or rappers that report the lies.  

{{< /details >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Dirty-mackin' bitches">}}

#### "Dirty-mackin' bitches because your spirit is insecure" > Dirty-mackin' bitches

* “Macking” refers to physical contact, conversations, or other flirtatious actions that a person does to flirt or attract someone with whom the person wants to have sex.  
 
* Dirty can be used to describe something that is dishonorable or something that is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.  
 
* Here Kendrick seems to be criticizing the “dirty ackin'” women and men whose "pillow-talking" is leading to neighborhood wars.  
 
* Kendrick seems to suggest the reason why men or women get into these "dirty-macking", "pillow-talking" sexual relationships because they are insecure men who need the validation of an attractive woman agreeing to have sex with them or insecure women who need the validation of a famous rapper expressing a strong desire to have sex with them.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Nasty">}}

#### "The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin' money as a backbone" > Nasty

* In slang, "flashy" is an adjective which describes someone who shows off or flaunts their wealth and possession. "Flashy niggas" might thus be included among those who "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth”.  
 
* The idea of “dirty” from the previous line gets escalated to “nasty”, conveys a sense of repulsion or aversion. Both "dirty" and "nasty" are used as slang adjectives to describe someone who is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.  
 
* The words "nasty" and "dirty" are both synonyms for the word "freaky" which Kendrick used when he described Drake as a "freaky ass nigga" and a "69 god"—in reference to an adventurous form of simultaneous oral sex-on "Not Like Us."  

  * *Devil is a lie, **he a 69 god**, ayy  
  **Freaky-ass niggas** need to stay they ass inside, ayy  
  ...  
  He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)  
  He a fan, he a fan, he a  
  **Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God  
  Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God**

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Backbone">}}

#### "The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin' money as a backbone" > Backbone

* In English "having a backbone" is an idiom for having the courage, strength, and ability to stand up for oneself.  
 
* Kendrick's criticism of "the flashy nigga" who is "usin' money as a backbone" may also be applied to Drake. Within the battle, Kendrick accused Drake of acting like a tough "street nigga" even though he has no backbone and has to pass real street niggas to join his crew an be his "backbone". However, as Kendrick pointed out, these "street niggas" who are paid to be Drake's "backbone" are actually a liability because they are not truly loyal to Drake and are only around for the money.  

  * *The **famous actor** we once knew is **lookin' paranoid** and now is spiralin'  
  ...  
  I like Drake with the melodies, **I don't like Drake when he act tough***  
  -"euphoria".  
     
  *Have you ever thought that **OVO is workin' for me**?  
  **Fake bully**, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person  
  **Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it**  
  ...  
  It was fun until **you started to put money in the streets**  
  **Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts**  
  ...  
  **If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught  
  that your entourage is only to hustle you  
  A hundred niggas that you got on salary  
  And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty**  
  And one of them is actually next to you  
  And **two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle  
  Just don't got the audacity to tell you***  
  -"6:16 in LA"
     
* Drake's strategy of paying "street niggas" and other tough guys to be part of his crew is well documented online most notably in [this video by HipHopMadness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hgN3ze96zU).

#### "I want his head cracked before he's back home" > Head cracked

* Kendrick give even more specific instructions on how he wants the hosts and attendees of "the party" to be executed. In this case, he orders his executioners kill the condemned man by hitting him in the head with some kind of blunt weapon until the man's skull is cracked open.  
 
* Kendrick orders for the execution to happen while the condemned man is out of his house and before the condemned man ever has a chance to come back home that day. The immediacy of these orders further highlights the idea that "it is time" to watch the party die.  
 
* The specificity of these execution orders resembles "XXX." from *DAMN.* where Kendrick talked about how he would kill someone who had killed his son by waiting outside of the building where the killer was located and then gun the killer down at his first opportunity.  

  * ***I'd wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block**  
  **I'd catch a nigga leavin' service** if that's all I got

#### "The radio personality pushin' propaganda for salary" > Propaganda

* A "radio personality" is host of an radio program, podcast or other form of audio based content who publicly broadcasts his or her perspective on current events or popular culture. 
 
* Propaganda is the deliberate dissemination of information, ideas, or messages that are often biased or misleading and are designed to influence public opinion, manipulate emotions, or promote a specific agenda or ideology. Propaganda is typically disseminated by powerful or influential political entity, government, industry or group who wants to influence the public in order to control their actions or hold on to power.
 
* Kendrick implies that many of these "radio personalities" are getting paid to use their platform to disseminate propaganda on behalf of the entertainment industry or on behalf of the systems which mentally enslave Black people.  
 
* It is notable that on his 2016 track, "Hype", Drake boasts about creating his own propaganda.  

  * *I don't take this shit for granted  
  **I do my own propaganda***  

* On the battle track "6:16 in LA", Kendrick accuses Drake of "playin' dirty with propaganda".  

  * *But let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie  
  **You playin' dirty with propaganda**, it blow up on ya  
  You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots  
  But **your reality can't hide** behind Wi-Fi  
  Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out  
  **The forced opinions is not convincin'**, y'all need a new route*  

* A few months after "Watch the Party Die" was released, Kendrick released the album *GNX* whose opening track "wacced out murals" mentions "Watch the Party Die" and specifically criticies a White comedy podcast host who controvertially joked about Black women being emotionally disregulated and violent.  

  * **Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman**, that's law  
  **I know propaganda work for them**, and fuck whoever that's close to them  
  **The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed**, slide on both of them  

* On the track "Worldwide Steppers" from *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Kendrick asserted that Hollywood's corporate leaders and employees are "silent murderers" who teach their deadly and deceptive philosophies in schools.

  * *Eight billion people on Earth, **silent murderers**  
  Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)  
  **Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies**  
  You either gon' be dead or in jail, **killer psychology***

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Sadistic">}}

#### "...casualty. I want agony, assault, and battery" > Sadistic

* In English the word "casualty" is used to refer to someone who has died—or in some cases someone who has been injured—during an act of violence such a war or a criminal attack.  
 
* In the most narrow legal definition, "assault" is a crime in which a someone causes reasonable fear that they will cause physical harm to another person or make unwanted physical contact with another person. Meanwhile, "battery" is a crime in which someone actually causes physical harm or makes unwanted physical contact.  
 
* The use of the terms "assault" and "battery" reminds us that the acts of all of these vigilante executions which Kendrick has ordered are illegal, criminal attacks.  
 
* Moreover, by saying that he wants the hosts and attendees of "the party" to experience extreme physical and mental suffering or "agony", Kendrick seems to not be satisfied with simply ridding society of wicked people. He seems to be expressing an unhealthy and sadistic enjoyment of knowing that wicked people will experience extreme suffering.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="New Earth in the New Testament">}}

#### "I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people" > New Earth in the New Testament

* The term “New Earth” originates from, "The Revelation", the final book in the New Testament and the Bible in which St. John sees a prophetic, visionary “Revelation” from Jesus.  
 
* In this prophetic vision, Jesus shows St. John how the oppression, persecution, violence and killings that Christians faced under various Roman Emperors from 64 to 100 AD are part of a much larger pattern of the \["devil" / "satan" / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”\] trying to bring death and destruction to those who follow Jesus as their Lord.  
 
* Jesus encourages various church communities to “overcome” not by starting a revolution or killing their oppressors, but by forgiving and loving the humans who are acting like enemies, but are really just under the control of the true enemy—the \["devil" / "satan" / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”\].  
 
* Jesus encourages these persecuted church communities to trust that one day Jesus will defeat the true enemy. Moreover, Jesus promised that one day, God will bring an end to the world as it currently exists and bring about a "New Heaven" which fully overlaps with a "New Earth". In this overlapping "New Heaven" and "New Earth" where all humans will know God, have a loving relationship with God, and obey God's commandments, which will lead to an eternal life of peace, justice and right relationships.  
 
* This transformation from the current Earth to the "New Earth" is described in the second to last chapter of "The Revelation" where St. John describes the end of his vision by saying:

  * I saw **a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away**, and the sea is no more. I saw **the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God**, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, **God's [tent / residence] is with humans, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; There will be no mourning, no crying, no pain, any more**. The first things have passed away.”  
    -Revelation 21:1-4

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="New Earth in New Age Spirituality">}}

#### "I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people" > New Earth in New Age Spirituality

* More recently, biblical concept of a "New Earth" has also been encorporated into "New Age" spirituality.  
 
* “New Age” spirituality is a somewhat fluid category of spiritual beliefs and practices that arose from the "hippie" and "counterculture" movement of the late 1960s. Teachers and practitioners of New Age spirituality blend Eastern spiritual traditions \(e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism)\ with some aspects of Western Christianity and a modern, secular humanist ethos.  
 
* After the initial popularity of New Age spirituality in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of New Age ideas in the late late 1990s and early 2000s due to the populaity of self-help psychology books by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle's is known best for his 1997 book *The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment* and his 2005 book *A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose*.  
 
* In 2008, the legendary Black talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, hosted Eckhart Tolle on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his book *A New Earth*. Oprah also added *A New Earth* to Oprah's Book Club and hosted a 10-week live online class series where Eckhart Tolle discussed *A New Earth* chapter by chapter.  
 
* Similar fashion to other forms of New Age spirituality, *A New Earth* takes some ideas from the Bible, such as St. John's vision of "a New Heaven and a New Earth" and subtly redefines it through the perspective of Eastern spiritual beliefs, practices, and terminology.  
 
* In particular, *A New Earth* builds on the concepts from Tolle's previous book *The Power of Now* to focus on the Buddhist/Hindu idea that humans must go through an “ego death” so that their suffering will end and their individual identities (or the illusion of their individual identities) can melt away into a new, unified harmony with the universe. Within Tolle's writing, this ego death is  said to take place through practices such a Buddhist forms of emptying meditation that lead a person to awaken into a greater state of awareness or “consciousness” in moment or in the “now”.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="New Testament and New Age in Kendrick's work">}}

#### "I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people" > New Testament and New Age in Kendrick's work

* While the influence of Christianity has already been well documented throughout this analysis, it should also be noted that Eckhart Tolle has clearly had a significant influence on Kendrick's work beginning at least as early as 2021 when Kendrick released a video introducing his new media production company, pgLang. This introductory video contains imagery of meditative practices, a clock in which every hour is labeled as "now", a scene were a young woman chooses "NOW" instead of "PAST" or "FUTURE", and a scene were Kendrick sits across from Eckhart Tolle and listens intently as Tolle gives spiritual/psychologial guidance.  
 
* On *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Eckhart Tolle is introduced as Kendrick's psychotherapist and a major contributor to the album.  

  * *Kodak Black, Oklama  
  **Eckhart Tolle**  
  And this here is the big stepper*  
  -"Worldwide Stepper"  
     
  Whitney:  ***You really need some therapy**.*  
  Kendrick: *Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about?*  
  Whitney:  *Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck.*  
  Kendrick: *Shit, everybody stupid.*  
  Whitney:  *Yeah, well, **you need to talk to somebody. Reach out to Eckhart.***  
  -"Father Time"  

* Eckhart Tolle's voice is heard on several occasions on the second half of *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*.  
   
  * *Mr. Duckworth...*  
  -"Count Me Out"  
     
  *If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you...*  
  -"Savior (Interlude)"  
     
  *This is how we conceptualize human beings*  
  -"Auntie Diaries"  
     
  *People get taken over by this pain-body, because this energy field that almost has a life of its own—it needs to periodically feed on more unhappiness.*  
  -"Mr. Morale"  

* On the last verse of "Rich Spirit", ends with Kendrick specifically referencing the "New Earth" after making references to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and other New Age concepts earlier in an the track.  

  * *Takin' my baby to school, then **I pray for her**  
  'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, **writin' testament**  
  Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite  
  **Universal shift**, I'm in a groove  
  ...  
  **The aloof Buddha, I'm Christ with a shooter  
  Praise to Muhammad**, I might nigga noose ya  
  ...  
  **Spirit medium**, I don't rap, brother  
  ...  
  **I'm fasting four days out the week**, brother  
  ...  
  **The New Earth** in hot pursuit, **two-hundred lives***  

* Whether Kendrick is currently seeing a vision of the traditional Christian understanding of a “New Earth” or the New Age version, the reference to a peaceful "New Earth" is in sharp contrast to the increasingly violent rhetoric that Kendrick is using throughout the verse.  
 
* Kendrick seems to be implying that the end goal of a "New Earth" justifies the means of violent and inhumane vigilante executions. This "ends-justify-the-means" logic twists the prophetic vision of a "New Earth" into dystopian, totalitarian vision of a bloody revolution and political purge.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Mollies">}}

#### "Let's kill the followers that follow up on poppin' mollies" > Mollies

* After ordering the executions of social media influencers on the previous verse, Kendrick is now adding the followers of those influencers to the execution list.  
 
* In particular he calls out the follower who are “poppin mollies”. "Molly" is slang for the pure, molecular—from which we get the name molly—form of psychoactive drug MDMA. This pure form of MDMA is distinguished from the drug ecstasy in which MDMA is mixed with other substances.  
 
* MDMA increases heart rate, makes users feel more energetic, induces increased emotional and sensory experience, increases feelings of connection and empathy and overall leads to feelings of euphoria. However, these positive feelings can lead to an emotional crash and increased anxiety after the effects of the drug wears off.  
 
* MDMA was originally used in the 1970s to assist with psychotherapy for conditions such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, by the 1980s forms of MDMA and eventually molly began to be used as a “party drug” at raves, electronic music concerts and other dance parties. Molly's status as a “party drug” connects to the recurring motif of "the party" throughout “Watch the Party Die”.  
 
* Molly has also been referenced in the lyrics of a countless number of songs by "rappers that report the lies" and "parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth".  
 
* It seems that Kendrick now wants to execute the followers who have been using mollie in order to prevent the usage of the drug from spreading to other innocent lives and negatively affective society.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Degenerates">}}

#### "from the obvious degenerates" > Degenerates

* The “followers” who are “poppin mollie” seems to be following the influence of people who Kendrick describes as “degenerates”. The word "degenerate" refers morally corrupt people or more generally to people who have lost desirable physical, mental or social characteristics.  
 
* Labeling a certain group of people with a term like “degenerates” has historicaly been a propaganda strategy for totalitarian rulers to justify eliminating certain cultural influences or killing off certain group of people.
 
* Most notably, in the Nazi Party in Germany began to describe modern art with the term "Entartete Kunst" meaning "Degenerate Art". In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany because such art was deemed "an insult to German feeling". The Nazi party also ran a propaganda campaign against "Degenerate Music" which specifically targeted jazz music due to its "Negroid excesses in tempo" and "Jewishly gloomy lyrics."  
 
* Given that Nazi propaganda would have labeled Kendrick's own form of hip hop music as "Degenerate Music", it is ironic that Kendrick is not labeling other media influencers as degenerates and executing them alongside "the radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary".

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Hope">}}

#### "that's failing to acknowledge the hope that we tryna spread" > Hope

* Kendrick again seems to be highlighting the hope of a "New Earth" that can be created after all of the wicked hosts and attendees of "the party" are elimiated from society.  

* Kendrick seems to be implying that the "degenerates" among the media influencers are spreading cynical criticism of Kendrick's message of hope. This assessement is conistent with the lines from the first verse where Kendrick said:  

  * ***Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit**  
  But they don't hate me, **they hate the man that I represent***  

* Because these influencers have been talking down at Kendrick and failing to talk positively about the hope that Kendrick and his supporters are trying to spread through Kendrick's music, Kendrick has included these influencers among those who will be viciously executed.

{{< details is_markdown="false" nest_level="0" is_lyric="true" title="or film that shit in hi-res" >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Vote">}}

#### "If I'm not his vote then you need to bring his fuckin' head" > Vote

* Kendrick's campaign of totalitarian executions seems to be taking place that is a nominal democracy. Elections are still being held and Kendrick could theoretically be voted out of power. However, if anyone tries to oppose him by running an effective opposition campain or even casting a vote for the opposition, Kendrick wants such a person to be beheaded.  
 
* This kind of election where voters are not free to cast their vote without suffering retribution for voting against the ruling party is often referred to as a "sham election".  
 
* Months before the release of "Watch the Party Die" in March of 2024, the United States and other Western European allies denounced Russia's presidential election as a "sham election" after Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President of Russia with 88% of vote, which happed to be the highest percentage vote in the history of Russian democracy.  
 
* Vladimir Putin's re-election follows more than a decade in which political opposition leaders have been harrassed, silenced, imprisoned and assasinated. The most recent casualty was Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian prison under suspicious circumstances in February of 2024, just a month before the election.  
 
* On the track "Savior" from *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Kendrick specifially highlighted Vladimir Putin as an example of oppresive leadership after he invaded Ukraine in Febrary of 2022 after claiming that Ukraine was governed by a neo-Nazi regime.  

  * **Vladimir making nightmares  
  But that's how we all think**  
  The collective conscious  
  Calamities on repeat  

* While Kendrick did highlight Vladimir Putin's destructive behavior on "Savior", Kendrick overall point seemed to be that Vladimir Putin is not unique or even outside of the norm. Instead, Kendrick asserted that Vladimir Putin's behavior simply reveals the way that all of us natrually think. Here on "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick proudly expresses this collective way thought as he seeks to eliminate anyone who does not support his vigilante campaign.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Bring his head">}}

#### "you need to bring his fuckin' head or film that shit in hi-res" > Bring his head

* Kendrick again exhibits sadistic tendencies as he demands to see the decapitated head of the person who did not vote for Kendrick. The executioners must either bring the decapitated head to Kendrick to see or they must film the decapitation in a high resolution video format so that Kendrick can see all of the small details when he watches the recording.  
 
* It is also notable that the Gospel accounts of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke all tell the story about a wicked queen who conspires to have the king order the beheading of a John, the great prophet who baptized Jesus. Moreover, she got the king to bring John's head to her on a dinner platter.  
     
  * John the Baptist was Jesus's cousin and was highly respected prophet who called the Israelites to "repent" \(i.e. change their way of thinking\) and be baptized. John also spoke out against the unjust actions of powerful figures including Herod, the puppet king of a Roman-controlled, Israelite region called Galilee.  
   
  * John the Baptist publicly criticized King Herod, telling him that it was not right or just for him to take his own brother's wife, Herodias, so that he could marry her for himself.  
   
  * The new queen, Herodias, became very angry at St. John the Baptist and got King Herod to arrest John. Still the queen was not satisfied with just arresting St. John. She wanted him to be killed even though the king was very reluctant to do so. Queen Herodias then looked for a way to kill the prophet John, much like Queen Jezebel looked for a way to kill the prophet Elijah.  
   
  * Then when King Herod threw a birthday party for himself, the queen sent her daughter to dance for Herodias and his guests at the party. The queen's daughter's dancing was apparently so stimulating and pleasurable for King Herod that without thinking he made an oath in front of all his guests that he would give the queen's daughter whatever she wanted.  
   
  * The daughter consulted with her mother, who immediately told her to ask the king to bring her the head of John the Baptist on a dinner platter. The king was sad and upset with himself because he really didn't want to kill John, but because he had made the oath in front of his guests and was too proud to look dishonorable by going back on his word, he agreed. He immediately ordered soldiers to decapitate John the Baptist and bring the head on a platter to the daughter who then presented it to the queen.  
   
* The fact that John the Baptist was decapitated due to a party where a younger girl danced in a sensual way to gratify a group of powerful men brings us back to the motif of "the party" and the alleged trafficing of underage girls for sex parties at Drake's mansion.  
 
* At the same time, by demanding for his executionors to bring him a the head of the man who refused to vote for him, Kendrick, the King of LA, is now playing the role of King Herod and Queen Herodias who unjustly killed the prophet, John the Baptist.

{{< details is_markdown="false" nest_level="0" is_lyric="true" title="Fuck these niggas up or show 'em just what prayer do?" >}}

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Lecrae">}}

#### "Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do" > Lecrae

* Here for the first time in "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick seems to reconsider whether he is doing the right thing by executing the hosts and attendees of "the party".  
 
* In particular Kendrick wonders whether Lecrae, a famous Christian rapper, would pray for the hosts and attendees of the party or "fuck these niggas up" by violently assaulting them.  
 
* Lecrae happens to be the most famous and successful artist in the history of the Christian hip hop (aka CHH). Christian hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that utilizes similar production, rapping and singing styles as mainstream hip hop. However, unlike mainstream hip hop, Christian hip hip is committed to presenting lyrics that help people understand and identify with Christian values, beliefs, and behavior.  
 
* Because of the necessary commitment to Christian values, beliefs and behavior, artists that are accepted as part of Christian hip hop will not make songs that glorify scamming, gluttony, sexual promiscuity or criminal activity. In fact it is very rare for Christian hip hip artists to release music with any words that would be considered explicit: including profanity, sexual terminology or racial slurs.  
 
* Despite the high moral and behavioral expectations that come with being a Christian hip hop artis, Lecrae had a rough upbriging that was similar to many mainstream hip hop artists.  
 
* Lecrae never met his father and was raised by a single mother in a low income, urban, Black neighborhood. He was not raised as a Christian but became a very committed Christian later in life. That background has allowed Lecrae to speak to the reality of "street life" while also being able to clearly articulate Jesus's teaching in language that is accessible to urban, Black audiences.  
 
* Similar to Kendrick on *To Pimp a Butterfly*, *DAMN.* and *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*, Lecrae has also publicly wrestled with his faith in God, hypocrisy among Christian leaders including himself, depression, personal struggles with addiction, and the weight of serving as a leader in a Black community facing various social issues.  

  * ***Last year I was feeling hopeless  
  I just wanted it to end**  
  People stealing money from me, man  
  I swear I thought that we was friends  
  **And I was so depressed, I was such a mess  
  I couldn't shake it off  
  Another murder on the television**  
  Man, somebody go turn it off  
  **I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it  
  Thought these people had my back boy  
  Then they tellin' me I asked for it  
  I guess I'm just another black boy  
  And then they killed Tamir Rice**  
  And they just go on with they life  
  They tellin' me shut up talking 'bout it  
  Like, I should just talk about Christ  
  But **the truth is I started to doubt God  
  I started to question my purpose  
  I started to act out**  
  I ain't wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile  
  **Doctors told me that my man died  
  I almost had a breakdown
  So tell depression it can fly away  
  Tell my doubts that they can die today**  
  I'ma catch me a wave, sail away  
  Can't stop me now*  
  -"Can't Stop Me Now (Destination)"  
     
  *I would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such  
  You know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch  
  **I was so involved, never thought that I could fall**, y'all  
  Right before the fall of 2015, I was all off  
  **It involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down**  
  Tweeted 'bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground  
  And Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times  
  This time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized  
  Doubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame  
  "Shame on you, 'Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus' name"  
  **Cut me deep, I was losing sleep**, "God, ain't these Your sheep?"  
  Why they hate me like they do? Maybe grace is really cheap  
  Maybe this is all a lie, they don't really love me  
  They just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public  
  They're like following they God mean turnin' on Black people  
  Is Black evil? **Why do they hate and attack people?**  
  I'm vulnerable and cautious, I'm reading Baldwin  
  Ta-Nehisi got me thinking, now I'm going all in  
  **I ain't know if God was real no mo'  
  Every day we gettin' killed and I can't deal no mo'  
  I started slipping in the darkness, I'm feeling heartless  
  Christians got me traumatized, I don't know who God is  
  Drinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree  
  Maybe I should get divorced**, I don't know why she married me  
  **What's the purpose? What's the point?  
  Nothing matters, I'm just matter, I'm just atoms  
  Ain't no Eve and ain't no Adam  
  Where the Xannies? Let me at 'em  
  I was floating in confusion until I dropped  
  Woke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped***
  -"Deconstruction"  

* Given his background and spiritual perspective, Lecrae seems to be the perfect person to provide Kendrick with a perspective on whether Kendrick should rely on prayer or use violence to improve society.  
 
* It is also notable that prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Lecrae released a [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/y2ZC1FEk87Q?si=syqzXoAhmBaRGzAv) in which he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake.  
     
  * In the podcast episode, Lecrae accepted that rap battles as an established part of hip hop culture. Since Lecrae grew up with hip hop culture, he was  reluctant to criticize rap battles in and of themselves.  
     
  * Lecrae also acknowledged that Kendrick was providing Drake with some feedback that he probably needed to hear.  
  
     *We all need friends like Kendrick who are willing to tell us about ourselves. I never want to have to run into somebody in a rap battle to tell me the truth about myself.*  
     
  * However, Lecrae did express his concern that the way that Kendrick and Drake approached the rap battle (and to some extent how most rappers approach rap battles) demonstrates an unhealthy attempt to build their own sense of value and self-worth based on their ability to beat down another person.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Prayer">}}

#### ""Fuck these niggas up or show 'em just what prayer do?" > Prayer

* Prayer was a major motif within *DAMN.*. Throughout that album, Kendrick repeatedly lamented that fact that no one was praying for him. However, at a pivotal point of the album,  Kendrick's cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail telling Kendrick that the cursed existence that he was experiencing was not due to a lack of people praying for Kendrick but due to a lack of Kendrick following God's commandments.  

  * *New Kung Fu Kenny  
  **Ain't nobody prayin' for me**  
  ...  
  Bitch, all my grandmas dead  
  So **ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head**, ayy*  
  -"ELEMENT."  
     
  ***Shit I feel like  
  Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin' for me  
  Ain't nobody prayin'  
  ...  
  I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em  
  But who the fuck prayin' for me?***
  -"FEEL."  
     
  ***Nobody pray for me**  
  It been that day for me*  
  -"HUMBLE."  
     
  *What's up, family? Yeah, it's your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately and **I know you feel like, you know people ain't been prayin' for you but you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people**. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, **that's why you feel like you feel, like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way**...  
     
  Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities". So **until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse**, because He said He's gonna punish us. The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel - He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods. "That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee." So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you, because He loves you. So that's why we get chastised. That's why we're in the position that we're in. **Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us. We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live, here, in today, in the United States of America**. I love you, family, and I pray for you. God bless you. Shalom.*  
  -"FEAR."

* *DAMN.* thus conveys the idea that prayer is insufficient if individual do not change the way that they live and begin to follow God's commandments. This idea about the need to follow God's commandments and help other to follow God's commandments might thus present a third way as opposed to exclusively praying or exclusively “fucking these niggas up.”

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry">}}

#### "I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1" > Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry

* Dee-1 is another Christian hip hop artist whose career has run in paralle to Lecrae's. Dee-1's first mixtape was released in 2004, the same year that Lecrae released his first album. However, Dee-1 has not come close to acheiving the level success or influence that Lecrae has had throughout his career.  
 
* Part of this gap in success could be attributed to skill level and artistic choices. However, from Dee-1's perspective a big part of the gap in success is due to the fact that Dee-1 has been uncompromising in his commitment to deliver music with a clear Christian message and a willingness to call out issues in hip hop culture and the music industry that he sees as being misaligned with Jesus's teaching.  
 
* With a timing and perspective that runs almost parallel to Katt Williams, Dee-1 gave given an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9subKGoAz8) in January of 2024 where he discussed how he has been denied opportunities from entertainment industry "gatekeepers" because he wouldn't compromize his own integrity. Most notably, Dee-1 talked about haveing to say "no" to powerful men in the entertainment industry who tried to coerce him into performing oral sex or receiving anal sex in order to receive a record deal.  
     
  * *There's gatekeepers. So **if you're trying to get signed to a major label, there's gatekeepers. If you're trying to get on certain media platforms to get interviewed, there's gatekeepers. If you trying to get on the mainstream radio, urban radio, there's gatekeepers**. Yes. Yes. Yes.  
     
  I will say one last thing about gatekeepers—**the only true gatekeeper to what's meant for you in this world is God and your level of integrity**. That's the only two gatekeepers, because what's meant for you and what you want that's two different things and a lot of times people end up wanting things that ain't of God. Now **if you want something that ain't of God, you got to go through gatekeepers..., who really ain't nobody in in the big scheme of things on the totem pole of people with integrity and people with morals values and principles**. These gatekeepers ain't nobody, **but in this perverted sick twisted industry these gatekeepers do hold access to certain levels**, you know.  
     
  Bro, **I've had gatekeepers in the music industry who have literally tried to hold a record deal behind their back and let me know like, "Look,if you a part of this homosexual act that I'm trying to take part in, this door open real quick fory you." I got a song where I've talked about that before called "The Devil's Playground."** This is real dog and the only way that that type of stuff can work on you is if you let them have all the leverage to where you want what's behind that gate that bad. So that's that's a real thing.  
     
  You also got people—**this a different type of gatekeeper—the gatekeepers who will say, "Hey you making too much righteous noise right now. If you just tone that righteousness down a little bit then we'll allow you into these doors, but you got to tone that down. You got to becomea little more vanilla, a little more lukewarm, a little more bland and you'll fit in with us. That's the slick gatekeeping. It ain't telling you to all the way, you know, bend over or or open your mouth or something like that. It ain't that, but it's telling you like dim your light.** And what ends up happening is you got so many people that's like, "Well that's not that bad. They not asking me to do nothing super crazy I just got to dim my light." That's the scariest kind right there 'cause a lot of people will be like, "Wait I just got to turn it from level 10 to level 5? Man, bet. I could do that. Bro, all right, bet. Now I get accepted. Cool." **Next thing, you know you got a whole industry that's lukewarm—whole industry lukewarm, so that when somebody that's on fire come along they looking at it like, "Whoa, you crazy! Hold on. You shining too bright**. Hold on. Hold on. Chill out, man. You doing the most. You messing up, man. Stop man."*

* As mentioned in that interview, back in 2017, Dee-1 released a track called "The Devil's Playground" in which he mentioned having to say no to powerful man in music industry who offered to manage Dee-1 if Dee-1 would have sex with him. Dee-1 highlighted this experience as an example of how the entire music industry is under the control of Lucifer (aka the "devil" / "satan" / "false accuser" / "diabolical one").  

  * ***Lucifer laughs when he listens to the radio  
  Enjoyin' all the hate blastin' through the stereo  
  His plan worked, our music gives him glory  
  Sex, drugs, and murder** now listen to this story...  
     
  **Down here with these devils in the playground  
  Evil forces workin' hard I can't play around  
  I can feel 'em tryin' to drag me down**  
  Think I'm gonna lose this battle now  
  I'm in the trenches here in Babylon  
  **This world of darkness that I travel on  
  I know the games that the devil plays  
  I feel him creepin' I can't get away**  
     
  **Devils on devils on devils on devils on devils  
  They all in this industry**  
  Not everybody real, and  
  **For the dollar bill friends turn into my enemies**  
  They knew I was broke  
  So **they asked me to sell my soul  
  Three Million dollars plus make a blood sacrifice  
  But I said, "Nooooooo"!  
  This man said if I slept with him he'll manage me**  
  Yeah, ya'll know him  
  **I spit in his face and said, "boy don't play with me!"**  
  I said, "Lord this just too much"  
  So I'm just gonna work with church folk  
  **Then I found out some of these church folk  
  Be some of the most crooked on Earth folk**  
  ...  
  **It's entertainment but it's deeper, though  
  Behind the scenes there's some things you don't even know  
  Messin' with this game, you could lose your soul  
  'Cause there's an evil creepin' deep below**  
  ...  
  **You think you the man, don't ya?  
  But the Devil got his hand on ya  
  The Devil's just usin' you**  
  He makin' a fool of you  
  Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, you right there  
  The one with the fame, the one with the money  
  The one with the platinum plaques, yeah, yeah  
  You know your name!  
  **I came in the game with the flame and I aim to be sayin'  
  Everything in the name of the Man who created**  
  The land, the sand, the sun, and the moon  
  Holds life in the palm of his hand  
  Do you hear what I'm sayin'?  
  Man, I'm really tryin' to wake you  
  This ain't no game so I can't be playful  
  **Sellin' these lies, music that's hateful  
  The devil say you great, but God say you ungrateful** (echo)  
  So what we gonna do now?  
  **This ain't beef it's more deep  
  I don't fight for me, I fight for the army of G-O-D**  
  But I luv you dawg, my brother for life  
  Separated at birth, but **I pray you come to the light***

#### "I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1" > Kendrick exposes the satanic music industry

* Dee-1's claim that the music industry is under the control of Lucifer / the "devil" is a view that Kendrick has also expressed going back to 2015 with the tracks "Alright" and "For Sale? (Interlude)" from *To Pimp a Butterfuly". In those tracks, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of a music industry leader named "Lucy", short for Lucifer, who approach Kendrick and offered Kendrick wealth, success, and material possessions if Kendrick would sell his soul to her.  

  * ***What you want you, a house? You, a car?  
  Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?  
  Anything, see my name is Lucy**, I'm your dog  
  Motherfucker, **you can live at the mall  
  I can see the evil**, I can tell it, I know it's illegal*  
  -"Alright"
     
  *Now, baby, **when I get you, get you, get you, get you**  
  **I'ma go hit the throttle with you  
  Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you  
  'Cause I (Want you)**  
  Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty  
  Registration is out of service  
  Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving  
  'Cause I (Want you)  
  (**I want you more than you know**)  
  ...  
  **I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby  
  You looked me in my eyes about four, five times  
  'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified  
  That I (Want you)**  
  You said **Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy**  
  I said, "You crazy?"  
  Roses are red, violets are blue  
  But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (Want you)  
  ...  
  You said to me, **you said your name was Lucy**  
  I said, "Where's Ricardo?"  
  You said, "Oh, no, not the show"  
  Then you spit a little rap to me like this  
  When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"  
  You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:  
  **"My name is Lucy, Kendrick**, you introduced me, Kendrick  
  Usually I don't do this but **I see you and me, Kendrick  
  Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories  
  About these rappers that I came after when they was boring  
  Lucy gon' fill your pockets  
  Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton  
  Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised  
  Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?  
  It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
  Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
  Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
  I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
  Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
  Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
  Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
  I want you to know that Lucy got you
  All your life I watched you
  And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that's possible"***  
  -"For Sale (Interlude)"  

* Moreover, a few months after the release of "Watch the Party Die", Kendrick released the album *GNX* which centers around the track "reincarnated" where Kendrick retells the biblical narrative pattern of "Lucifer". In Kendrick's retelling, Lucifer is a fallen angel who has been reincarnated numerous times in the form of various musicians whose gluttony led them to use their musical skills and influence to deceive the masses and mentally enslave them under Lucifer's control.  

  * *I did **past life regression** last year and it fucked me up  
  **Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus  
  Body after body**, lesson after lesson, let's take it **back to Michigan in 1947  
  My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him**  
  I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing  
  **Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level  
  The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel**  
  And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world  
  With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled  
  **I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect  
  While the record business loved me  
  I was head of rhythm and blues  
  The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose  
  But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses  
  Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated**  
  ...  
  **Another life had placed me as a Black woman** in the Chitlin' Circuit  
  **Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains  
  My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed  
  A musical genius** what the articles emphasized  
  **Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction  
  Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted**  
  Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be  
  **Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity  
  Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments  
  I needed drugs**, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin  
  **Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar  
  Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'**  
  My first assistant was a small town scholar  
  Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her  
  **My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me  
  I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated**  
  ...  
  **My present life is Kendrick Lamar  
  A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe**  
  The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar  
  My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh  
  **My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him  
  I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'  
  Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment**  
  I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious  
  I'm yelling, "Father, did I finally get it right?" Everything I did was selfless  
  I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them  
  I didn't gloat, even told 'em, "No," when the vultures came  
  Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed  
  Son, you do well, but your heart is closed  
  I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself  
  Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down  
  "But **your pride has to die**," okay, Father, show me how  
  Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for  
  I kept one hundred institutions paid  
  Okay, tell me more  
  I put one hundred hoods on one stage  
  Okay, tell me more  
  I'm tryna push peace in L.A.   
  But you love war  
  No, I don't  
  Oh, yes, you do  
  Okay, then tell me the truth  
  **Every individual is only a version of you  
  How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?**  
  I could tell you where I'm going  
  **I could tell you who you are  
  You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious  
  Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous  
  Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent  
  My greatest music director was you**  
  It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues  
  It was harmony and motion  
  **I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken  
  Rehabilitation, not psychosis**  
  But now we here now  
  **Centuries you manipulated man with music  
  Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving  
  You came a long way from garnishing evilish views**  
  And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval  
  I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear  
  The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real  
  The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel  
  I'm using words for inspiration as an idea  
  So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?  
  I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding  
  For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?  
  I vow my life just to live one in harmony now  
  **You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity**  
  And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy  
  Then let's rejoice where we at  
  **I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated***

#### "I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1" > Call It Like It Is

* Prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Dee-1 released a podcast episode which discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake. In comparison to Lecrae's podcast, Dee-1 was much more willing to directly criticize Drake, Kendrick and the culture of rap battles as a whole.  

* From Dee-1's uncompromising perspective, the entire battle between Kendrick and Drake has glorified negative examples of hatred and unrighteous relationships that are a detriment to the Black community and misaligned with Jesus's teaching.  

* Dee-1 also released an uncompromising response to “Watch the Party Die” in the form a track titled “Call It Like It Is”.  

  * I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1  
  But I will—  
  **Yeah, I don't care what these people think, I'm trying to make these people think  
  What's up, Kendrick?** We flippin' tables, man, (Call it like it is), alright  
  ...  
  **Y'all done turned this culture trash, these so-called legends ain't no legends  
  I don't care if they sold millions, are you hearin' their message?  
  Poisonin' our whole community, everybody hypnotized**  
  Why you think nobody respect black people? No big surprise  
  (Call it like it is) and **I love New Orleans, my city  
  But I love God way more, I don't care if none of y'all with me  
  We celebrate bein' stupid and everybody so gangster**  
  But when you clockin' for that white man, you be on your best behavior, hold up  
  (Call it like it is) Yeah, most of the media people laugh  
  Y'all was never really, really cool before you got inside this here game  
  Instigating, y'all bein' messy, **you ain't helping nobody grow**  
  Tell Joe Budden I'm on a mission, so don't butt in, Joe  
  Man, I'm gon' (Call it like it is), no, it ain't no pressure on me  
  I'm applyin' the pressure, **I'm powered by G-O-D  
  And we gon' be alright, that's what Kendrick Lamar said**  
  And in the words of Lil Wayne, the sky is the limit, yeah  
  ...  
  **So call it like it is, call it what it ain't**  
  Call it what you want, no, I ain't on that train  
  **I'm speakin' from the soul, and I don't care who feel' it  
  Yeah, hip-hop is dead, and y 'all the ones who killed it**  
  No, I am not impressed nah, and I say that with my chest (Uh-huh)  
  Don't try to call me preaching, refer to me as blessed  
  So call it like it is and call it what it ain't (ain't)  
  So call it what you want (want), no, I ain't on that train  
  ...  
  **Y'all boys claim to be some soldiers  
  But you soldiers ain't no soldiers**, man, I told you and I showed you  
  I'm a soldier for life, stop playin' dumb, **it's good versus evil, it's only two sides**  
  Class in session, y'all need to attend, just like my shoe size  
  Murder music hit different when somebody in my crew died  
  The biggest gangsters in rap got blonde hair 'n' blue eyes  
  **We gettin' pimped, what y'all wanna do, guys?  
  Your new single just dropped? (Yeah) Time to entertain us with new lies**  
  Whoever said I'm canceled, man, I'm laughing in these people's face  
  **I work for God, dummy, my impact could never be erased**  
  Tell America, **I'm the same brother I used to be  
  Before y'all was introduced to me, consistency ain't new to me**  
  (So call it like it is) **Y'all just sold us all with your foolery  
  And that dollar bill got y 'all whipped**, that's dead, man, it's the eulogy  
  And **whoever said what they gon' do to me?  
  Man, I hit your whole block up with prayers, man, y'all ain't used to me**  

* It is notable that Kendrick does not ask what Dee-1 would do. Given Dee-1's consistent, uncompromising commitment to Jesus's teaching above Black identity, hip hop culture, personal grievances or revolutionary philosophies, Kendrick probably knows that Dee-1 would "show 'em just what prayer do" without a second thought.

#### "I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1" > Kendrick's contradictions

* Kendrick sees within Dee-1 an empathetic, Christ-centered heart that Kendrick has deep inside of himself even while his hardened exterior has led him to advocate for killing the killers, burning the whole village, mortifying family members, cracking skulls, imposing agony, decapitating those who oppose him.  
 
* This contradiction between Kendricks Christian-leaning heart and his tendencies towards violence (or at least existing in an environment of violence) is a major theme of Kendrick's work throughout his discography.  

  * *Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah  
  Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah  
  **Really I'm a sober soul

  Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street**  
  With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?  
  **If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?**  
  Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?  
  And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep  
  With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor  
  Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage  
  **Kill 'em all if they gossip***

  **The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness  
  And the beauty within the caterpillar  
  But having a harsh outlook on life  
  The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak  
  And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits**  
  Already surrounded by this mad city  
  The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon  
  Which institutionalizes him  
  **He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped**  
  When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as  
  Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city  
  The result?  
  Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant  
  Finally free, **the butterfly sheds light on situations

#### "I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1" > Speaking from the heart

* It is worth noting that according to Jesus's teaching, it is not possible for someone to have a truly empathetic heart if that persons words and actions are not consistently empathetic.  
 
* In the same speech from St. Matthew's account of the Gospel where Jesus taught his disciples the Lord's Prayer, Jesus used a metaphor of trees and fruit to teach his disciples that people who have good in their heart will produce good words and actions and anyone who had evil in their heartwill produce evil words and actions. By contrast, anyone who produces evil words and actions does not truly have good in their hearts.  

  * ***Beware of false prophets**, who come to you **in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are greedy wolves**. **By their fruits you will know them**. Can you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, **every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit**. Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.*  
  -Matthew 7:15-20  

* In a parallel speech in St. Lluke's account of the Gospel according, Jesus gives the same teaching while specifically using the word heart.

  * ***The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from the abundance that fills a person's heart.***  
  -Luke 6:43-45  

* Jesus's warning against false, corrupt prophets is particularly notable given that on “Mortal Man”, throughout “DAMN.” and on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick has spoken about how he is prophet to the Black community in America.  
 
* Hence, from the perspective of Jesus's teaching, Kendrick's inconsistent actions and words—particularly within "Watch the Party Die"—would seem to indicate that there is a deep inconsistency within Kendrick's heart as Kendrick's heart seems to contain both empathy and a pathological desire for ruthless vigilante retribution.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Censored">}}

#### "But I will—" > Censored

* Unexpectedly, Kendrick never finishes this line. He seems to be censoring himself. We are thus left to guess what Kendrick intended to say (“Dee-1” could be rhymed with “gun”).  
 
* That being said, the specifics of what the uncensored line might not be that important. Thus far, all the lines on the verses have been advocating for the use of violence to execute people who Kendrick judges to be detrimental to society. Almost surely, the uncensored line would have continued the same trend. The more interesting question is why amongst all the lines that contained profanity and violence, Kendrick picked this line to censor.  
 
* The censorship here could convey the idea that the uncensored line would have been so extremely violent and direct that it would make the song “X-rated”.  
 
* The previous time that Kendrick got so specific about the way that he would kill killer was on the track “XXX.” where Kendrick rapped:

  * *I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'  
  I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'  
  I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'  
  I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap  
  Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that”*  
  **X-rated**  

* Given that Dee-1 does not use profanity or advocate for people to commit acts of violence, Kendrick's tendency towards X-rated content again positions Kendrick as someone who is in many ways the exact opposite of Dee-1.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Heavy metals">}}

#### "It's time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword" > Heavy metals

* After previously referring to his execution targets as “degenerates” Kendrick continues to escalate his rhetoric by seemingly referring to them as “devils”. Labeling his execution targets as "devils" again seems to be an attempt to justify certain groups of people with a sword, potentially involving more decapitations.  
 
* “Heavy metal” is a subgenre of rock music which tends to feature violent and spiritually dark imagery in the song lyrics and band names.  
 
* The original meaning of “heavy metals” refers to a category of chemical elements from the periodic table of elements. Kendrick thus seems to be making a subtle reference to his song “ELEMENT.” where he justified and glorified using violence to take revenge and fight against his enemies.  

  * *I'm willin' to die for this shit  
  I done cried for this shit, **might take a life for this shit  
  Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit**  
  D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy  
  I been stomped out in front of my mama  
  My daddy commissary made it to commas  
  Bitch, all my grandmas dead  
  So **ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head**, ayy

  I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga  
  **I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga**  
  We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope  
  That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know  
     
  **If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy  
  If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy  
  I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy  
  They won't take me out my element**  
  Nah, take me out my element  
  ...  
  I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy  
  An imaginary rich nigga, ayy  
  Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Spiritual swordfights">}}

#### "It's time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword" > Spiritual swordfights

* It is notable that in St. Paul's letter to the Church in Ephesus, St. Paul uses the imagery of armor, swords and warfare as a metaphor to describe how Christians should fight against spiritual forces including the "devi" \(aka "satan" / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”\) and the “element” forces of the world.  

  * *Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. **Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the methodology of the \["devil" / "satan" / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”\]**. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but **against the element**, against the powers, **against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age**, and **against the spiritual forces of wickedness** in the heavenly places.  
     
  Therefore **put on the whole armor of God**, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of right relationships, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News \(aka Gospel\) of peace, above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to **quench all the fiery darts of the evil one**. And take the helmet of salvation, and **the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God**; with all prayer and requests, **praying at all times in the Spirit**, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints.*  
     
  -Ephesians 6:10-18

* In that passage, St. Paul makes it clear that Christians are not meant to be fighting or killing other humans (or as St. Paul says “flesh and blood”), because other humans are never the real enemy. Instead, St. Paul instructs the member of the church to go to war against “spiritual forces of wickedness”, not the humans who are doing things that are “too wicked to apologize”.  
 
* In order to defend against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to put on “spiritual armor” which refers to virtues such as truth, right relationships, peace derived from Jesus's Good News, faith, salvation.  
 
* In order to fight offensively against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to wield “the sword of the Spirit” which is a metaphor for the “word of God” that is conveyed though Jesus's teachings as told in the texts of Bible.  
 
* St. Paul also instructs Christians to fight the spiritual war “with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit.”  
 
* Similarly, in St. Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul made it clear that Christians are not meant to use physical weapons to fight against human enemies but spiritual weapons to fight against prideful patterns and thoughts and arguments which attempt to exalt themselves to make mak humans act according to those prideful patterns of thoughts and arguments instead of obeying Jesus's commandments.  

  * For though we walk in the [flesh / body], **we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires]**, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. **We are destroying arguments and all pride that exalts itself against the knowledge of God**, and we are **taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ**.  
  -2 Corinthians 10:3-5  

* Hence, St. Paul clearly teaches Christians to “show 'em what prayer do”. Moreover, St. Paul also instructs Christians to be transformed by Jesus's teaching so that they can develop the kinds of virtues that will allow them to fight against prideful thoughts and arguments that would justify wickedness, including any acuments that would justify brutally killing other humans.

{{< details is_markdown="true" nest_level="1" is_lyric="false" title="Hollywood divorce">}}

#### "We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce" > Hollywood divorce

* “Hard” seems to be connected to the idea of “heavy metal” on the previous line. These “hard disputes” seem to be part of some unresolvable marital conflict that will eventually end in divorce. Based on the context of the song, it would seem that Kendrick plans to settle these “hard disputes” by killing the people with whom he has a dispute.  
 
* Additionally, the reference to a “ghetto Hollywood divorce”, suggests that the dispute could be “contract dispute” between Black artists and an entertainment industry company.  
 
* Here Kendrick seems to be commenting on the relationship that “corporate guys” and “rappers who tell the lies” have forged to profit from distributing fabricated stories about being “street niggas just like Hollywood has profited from distributing fabricated stories.  
 
* Kendrick also seems to be alluding to the Outkast song “Hollywood Divorce”, in which Outkast, Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg used the image of a volatile Hollywood celebrity marriage as an extended metaphor for how entertainment industries appropriate Black culture only to later divorce themselves from the Black artists while holding on to the profits and intellectual property.  

  * ***Starts off like a small town marriage**  
  Lovely wife and life, baby carriage  
  **Now all the stars have cars, success of course  
  But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce**  
  ...  
  And I'm a star  
  Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood  
  'Cause **Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on  
  I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song  
  I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home**  
  The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home  
  And all I got in return was a durn country song  
  This whole country wrong  
  Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on  
  And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs  
  But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra  
  I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood  
  Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller  
  Hold up, your grill's glistenin'  
  Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different  
  What's the real sense of it?  
  **Bling bling, I know and did you know  
  I'm the creator of the term**, I just straightened the perm  
  They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn  
  **Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn  
  Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece**  
  That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease  
  And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze  
  Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne  
  But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none  
  So **that's why I got a pre-nup**  
  I do  
  ...  
  **I do, love you but you hate me at the same time**  
  Lights, camera, action, it's game time  
  **Do you take this here as your lovely wife?  
  To love her and cherish her for all your life?  
  I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there  
  And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair**  
  It's been a long time, we walked a thin line  
  Others say they got you, but you been mine  
  As I sit back and watch all the catfights  
  **Domestic violence — is that right?**  
  But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight  
  And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up  
  **I never ever thought that we would separate at all  
  But you played me like a game of football  
  Used to feed me, need me, dress me  
  Now it's so messy, straight cut out and left me**  
  ...  
  **(Starts off like a small town marriage)  
  Hollywood divorce  
  All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing**  
  (Lively wife and life, baby carriage)  
  **Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap  
  (Now all the stars have cars, success of course)  
  Not even talkin' about music  
  Everything else, too  
  (But it ends in Hollywood divorce)  
  By the time it reach Hollywood, it's over  
  (Hollywood divorce)**  
  But it's cool  
  **We just keep it goin' and make new shit  
  Take our game, take our name  
  Give us a little fame  
  And then they kick us to the curb, that's a cold thang***

#### "the signatures is bein' forged" > Forged signatures

* Kendrick seems to be warning other hip hop artists about the hard disputes and metaphorical divorce that will happen to them in the future if they sign a contract with an exploitative entertainment company.  
 
* The idea that the signatures are being “forged” indicates that the "corporate guys" in the entertainment industry are actually committing acts of fraud to illegally profit from "rappers that report the lies" and use the leverage of paid lawyers and the legal system against Black artists.  
 
* The imagery of signatures from the entertainment industry also brings to mind the *To Pimp a Butterfly* track “For Sale? (Interlude)” in which Lucifer (aka the "devil" / "satan" / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) comes to Kendrick in the form of a music industry executive named Lucy. Lucy tries to get Kendrick to sign a contract to sell his soul to her in exchange for wealth, possessions and an agreement that Kendrick will stop praying and abandon his loving relationship with God the Father.  

  * ***My name is Lucy, Kendrick**, you introduced me, Kendrick  
  Usually I don't do this but I see you and me, Kendrick  
  Lucy give you no worries, **Lucy got million stories  
  About these rappers that I came after when they was boring  
  Lucy gon' fill your pockets  
  Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton  
  Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised  
  Lucy just want your trust and loyalty**, avoiding me?  
  It's not so easy, **I'm at these functions accordingly**  
  Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder  
  **Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father  
  I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly  
  Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me**  
  Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front  
  **Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork**  
  I want you to know that Lucy got you  
  All your life I watched you  
  And now you all grown up to **sign this contract**,  
  if that's possible*  

* The word “forged” is also double entendre referring to the process of shaping metal into a weapon, tool or object. This connects back to previous line about “heavy metals on my sword”.
