## About me

This is a blog written by me, Femi "Athanasios" Olutade. I spend a lot of my free time exploring and organizing ideas that I think can help my kids live better lives. Other people might also find such ideas helpful, so I've discussed them on a few platforms.

### Dissect

On the internet, I'm primarily known for my contributions to the [Dissect podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2b025hq3gJ17tQdxS3aV43?si=9f291cc30d314dcc), which presents line-by-line analysis of influential albums, primarily hip hop albums.

### Ethnic background

I am ethnically West African. "Femi" is short for "Oluwafemi" which means "The Lord loves me" in the [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) of the Yoruba [ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people). "Olutade" roughly translates to "The Lord is equal to a crown" in Yoruba.

My parents were born, raised and schooled in [Nigeria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria). They immigrated to the U.S. a few months before I was born. I grew up in the States with a mix of African, African-American and mainstream American cultural influences.

I became deeply interested in hip hop when I was 14 years old after I saw the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVObfpaR2_I) for 2Pac's posthumously released track ["Thugz Mansion" (Acoustic) ft. Nas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVObfpaR2_I).

### Spiritual background

My parents were raised in the Anglican Church.
