  Telekinesis
    
      &ldquo;Telekinesis, I&rsquo;m purifying these D speeches&rdquo; &gt; Telekinesis

In science fiction and fantasy media, telekinesis refers to the ability to move or manipulate objects with the mind or thoughts and without any physical interaction. Within the context of a pivotal rap verse, Ghostface seems to be saying that he is about to move us emotionally using the thoughts that are coming from his mind.


    






  D speeches
    
      &ldquo;Telekinesis, I&rsquo;m purifying these D speeches&rdquo; &gt; D speeches


In street culture, “D” can be short for “dope” or “drug”. For example the term “d boys” is short for “dope boys”, which refers to drug dealers. In numerous songs and interviews, Ghostface has rapped and talked about his past experience as a drug dealer. Hence, “D speeches” could be a reference to rap verses and other speech which glorifies drug dealing.">

  "articleBody": " Telekinesis, I’m purifying these D speeches Telekinesis “Telekinesis, I’m purifying these D speeches” \u003e Telekinesis In science fiction and fantasy media, telekinesis refers to the ability to move or manipulate objects with the mind or thoughts and without any physical interaction. Within the context of a pivotal rap verse, Ghostface seems to be saying that he is about to move us emotionally using the thoughts that are coming from his mind. D speeches “Telekinesis, I’m purifying these D speeches” \u003e D speeches In street culture, “D” can be short for “dope” or “drug”. For example the term “d boys” is short for “dope boys”, which refers to drug dealers. In numerous songs and interviews, Ghostface has rapped and talked about his past experience as a drug dealer. Hence, “D speeches” could be a reference to rap verses and other speech which glorifies drug dealing.\nThe idea that “D speeches” refers to Ghostface talking about drugs would connect to the lyrics of the hook where Kendrick says “I know y’all love it when the drugs talkin'”\npurifying “Telekinesis, I’m purifying these D speeches” \u003e purifying “Purifying” refers to the act of making something pure or clean by removing substances that are unwanted or that differ from the main substance.\nWithin the theme of drug dealing, there are various processes through which a recreational drug could be purified so that the drug is more potent.\nHowever, given the Christian spiritual themes that are woven throughout Ghostface’s verse, it seems more notable that making humans, places and objects “pure” or “clean” is a central theme throughout the Bible.\nWithin the biblical context, particularly within the Old Testament, something that is “impure” is not allowed to enter God’s temple or come near to anything that is set apart (or holy) to be used for any purpose that is related to the worship of God. Moreover, if an “impure” human, place, or object touches another human, place or object that is “pure”, the previously pure object becomes “impure.”\nIn some cases, humans, places and objects in the biblical narratives can become impure because they come into contact with physical things such as blood, skin diseases or certain animals. However, on a deeper level, humans, places and objects can become impure because of human words or actions that are unrighteous, unjust, immoral, or contrary to God’s commandments. (See the Bible Project videos for “Holiness” and “Atonement \u0026 Purification”)\nHence, by saying “I’m purifying these D speeches”, Ghostface seems to be expressing his intention to make his rap verses and speeches pure by removing everything that is unrighteous, unjust, immoral or contrary to God’s commandments. Moroever, by “purifying his D speeches”, Ghostface seems to be preparing himself for an opportunity to come near to God. Within the context of this verse, coming near to God seems to be possible by coming “to the feet of the sweet Jesus” who is identified as the Son of God.\nIt is notable that in a 2024 interview on the “Touré Show”, Ghostface discussed how “cussing” or speaking any profanity is a sin which he needs to stop doing and ask for forgiveness whenever he does use profanity in his speeches.\nYou got to look at your life right now and basically just try to do good deeds. Just do good. Listen—me cussing is a sin. Don’t look at it like its a bullshit sin. These are spells that we throwing around every time you cuss. We’re not supposed to even say that. I’m about the cuss again but I ask for forgiveness.\nAdditionally, in a 2022 interview with Fact Magazine, Ghostface discussed his desire to release a rap album about God.\nI wanna rhyme about God, I wanna do a God album, a positive album so the kids and everybody will understand what’s going on. I want to tell what’s going on through my eyes. I don’t wanna give too many of my ideas away because people just be taking them. Feed the poor people, feed the animals, that’s one of the main reasons I’m here. God put me here to teach people and to lead people to his direction. I’m not a Christian, I’m a Muslim but God is one. I just believe in the Most High. I know what my duty is.\nWhile I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus Crying “While I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus” \u003e Crying The image of Ghostface Killah crying builds on the theme of crying that has already een established throughout the first half of Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.\nThe album begins with the song “United in Grief” in which featured a hook in which Kendrick repeatedly says “I grieve different” in between verses before finally saying “Everybody grieves different” at the end of the track. The final verse of “United in Grief” also ends with Kendrick saying “the money wiping the tears away” in reference to his attempts to deal with his grief through expensive, luxury cars, jewelry, houses, and guns.\nMost notably, “Purple Hearts” comes directly after the track “We Cry Together”, in which Kendrick seems to acknowledge the shared experience of a “pain body” that leads to a cycle of conflicts in romantic relationships, including within Kendrick’s relationship with Whitney.\nGiven that “Purple Hearts” comes right after “We Cry Together” this line seems to suggest that intense conflict between Kendrick and Whitney or any two individuals in a marriage or mating relationship is really a cry for help—a cry is meant to lead both individuals to humble themselves at the feet of Jesus.\nClean the feet of Jesus “While I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus” \u003e Clean the feet of Jesus The image of someone crying while cleaning Jesus’s feet is a clear reference to the story of the prostitute who met Jesus in a St. Luke’s account of the Gospel in Luke 7:36-50.\nIn that story, Jesus went to eat at the house of a man named Simon who was an upstanding member of an influential religious leadership group called the Pharisees. At this point in the Gospel narrative, word had spread throughout the region that Jesus was a prophet who had the power to heal people, free people where were previously under the control of demons, forgive people of their sins, and reconnect people to God. Moreover, Jesus had been creating a great deal of controversy among the judgemental members of the Pharisee religious group as he was welcoming “sinners” into his community of followers and giving them the opportunity to “repent” by turning away from their sinful behavior.\nNews about Jesus eating at the religious leader’s house came to the attention of a woman who was notorious for being a “sinner”, which in the context of the Gospel accounts would seem to indicate that she was a prostitute. Despite the societal shame of being known as a prostitute and sinner, this particular woman took an expensive container of “sweet-smelling” perfume, went to the religious leader’s house. When she got to the house, the woman showed a tremendous amount of contrition and humility as she cried so much that she was able to use her tears to wet Jesus’s dusty feet. She then used her own hair to wipe Jesus’s feet. Finally, she showed a tremendous amount of honor towards Jesus by kissing Jesus’s feet and pouring the “sweet-smelling” perfumed oil on Jesus’s feet.\nIt is notable that the perfume was likely purchased with her earnings as a prostitute. Moreover, instead of pouring out the perfumed oil on Jesus’s feet she could have alternatively used the sweet smelling oil to attract more clients to her prostitution. Hence, the very act of using the perfume to anoint Jesus’s feet rather than putting it on herself was an act of turning away from her sinful behavior and turning towards God.\nSimon, judgemental Pharisee, immediately concluded that Jesus must not be a true prophet from God because he allowed himself to be associated with and even touched by someone who was a notorious sinner. Within the spiritual practices that were introduced in the Old Testament, someone who sinned as much as a prostitute was clearly considered “impure” and anyone who this “impure” woman touched would also be considered “impure.”\nJesus was well aware of Simon’s conclusion and in response told an allegorical parable story, about two debtors who owed money to the same lender and were both unable to pay the money back. One debtor would have to work for almost a year and a half to pay back his debts. The other debtor would only have to work about a month and a half to pay back his debts. Within their society, the two debtors likely would have been sold as slaves or sent to a debtors prison. However, rather than enforce this consequence, the lender graciously decided to forgive both of the debtors of all their debts.\nAs a follow up question, Jesus asked which of the debtors would love the lender more. The obvious answer was that the debtor who had a larger debt to forgive would show more love to the lender.\nJesus used the story of this parable as a metaphor to illustrate the difference between the prostitute and the upstanding member of the religious group.\nMuch like the debtor who owed a year and half’s worth of wages, the prostitute was convinced that she had a greater debt to society because she had sinned and distanced herself from God to a greater degree than those around her. Thus, because Jesus had proven to be someone who was willing to offer God’s forgiveness regardless of how much she had sinned, she was filled with an overwhelming amount of love for Jesus.\nThe prostitute expressed this love by humbling herself, cleaning Jesus’s feet, and offering oil that would have been very valuable and precious to her. In response, Jesus declared that all her sins were forgiven “because she loved so much,” which effectively meant that the former prostitute was now considered to be “pure” in the eyes of God.\nIn contrast, the upstanding member of the religious group did not think that he had sinned very much and thus did not value or appreciate Jesus’s offer of forgiveness and did not show much evidence of loving Jesus or even loving God. It naturally follows that this man’s sins may not be forgiven in the future because he does not love very much. Parallels to Mr. Morale “While I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus” \u003e Parallels to Mr. Morale The story of the prostitute who cried as she cleaned Jesus’s feet has numerous parallels to the state in which Kendrick finds himself throughout Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.\nMuch like the prostitute, Kendrick’s experience of living in poverty eventually led him to a degree of sexual promiscuity which was destructive to his relationships and caused him to distance himself from God.\nThroughout the album, Kendrick seems to be searching for God so that he can ask whether his sins can be forgiven. This is stated most explicitly on “Mother I Sober” where Kendrick raps:\nWhere’s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today\nI transformed, prayin’ to the trees, God is taking shape\n…\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?\nJesus declares that the prostitute’s choice to clean his feet is an act that clearly demonstrates the love in her heart. This connects to a larger theme across the album where Kendrick repeatedly questions what true love really is.\nThis ain’t Monopoly, watchin’ for love, this ain’t monogamy, y’all gettin’ fucked\n-“N95”\nDo you love me? Do you trust me?\nCan I trust you? Don’t judge me\n-“Die Hard”\nEarly mornin’ wake-ups (Wake-ups), practicin’ on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)\nTough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)\nNeat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)\nNeat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser\n…\nI got daddy issues, that’s on me\nLookin’ for, “I love you”, rarely empathizin’ for my relief\n-”Father Time”\nMore power to ya, love ’em from a distance\n-“Rich Spirit”\nNow, if it’s love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes\nAnd if I feel where your heart can be, you’ll still be a part of me\nI love my, love my (Love my, love my)\nSummer in the storm, I cannot conform\n(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)\nI just might love you still, just think I love me more\nIt ain’t love if you gon’ judge me for my past\nNo, it ain’t love if you ain’t never eat my ass\nIt ain’t love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag\nThat’s why I’m anti-everyone before this mask\n-“Purple Hearts”\nYou walk around like everything is in control\nFavor come with favors and you can’t say no\nGo out the way to make the coin available\nThat’s what I call love\nThe closest ones afraid to say they need some time\nThe turnaround is life or death, but you don’t mind\nGo out the way to say you made the compromise\nThat’s what I call love\n…\nBut the time it’ll come to not be there when somebody needs you\nYou say no and all you’ve done gives them amnesia\nOne thing I’ve learned, love can change with thе seasons\n…\nThey idolize and praise your name across the nation\nTap the feet and nod the head for confirmation\nPromise that you keep the music in rotation\nThat’s what I call love\n…\nI can’t please everybody\nI can’t please everybody\nLove gon’ get you killed\n-“Crown”\nYou said, “Kendrick, ain’t no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n‘Faggot, faggot, faggot,’ we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say ‘Nigga’”\n-”Auntie Diaries”\nBefore I go in fast asleep, love me for me\nI bare my soul and now we’re free\n-“Mother I Sober”\nI realized true love’s not savin’ face\nBut unconditional\n-“Mirror” Much like Jesus’s critique of the upstanding member of the religious group, Kendrick critiques members of Christian groups who do not seem to truly love the people around them, particularly on the track “Auntie Diaries”.\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic ‘cause the pastor didn’t see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n“Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,” it hurt\nYou the most ‘cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, “Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?” Kendrick and Keisha “While I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus” \u003e Kendrick and Keisha It is fairly ironic that Kendrick is implicitly being compared to a prostitute because Kendrick’s 2011 album Section.80 includes a track called “Keisha’s Song” in which Kendrick tells the story of a local prostitute who continued to endure the hazardous conditions of sex worker in Compton because “she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner’s redemption.”\nShe suddenly realize she’ll never escape the allure\nOf a Black man, white man needing satisfaction\nAt first, it became a practice, but now she’s numb to it\nSometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it\nBut she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner’s redemption, that sounds foolish Tragically, Keisha’s story ends with her getting stabbed to death by a client.\nKeisha rushing to that\nBlock away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked\nAnd in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where\nNothing really matters, still she hit the back seat\nThen caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street\nAfter recounting Keisha’s story, Kendrick also recounts the moment after he finished recording the song when he sat his eleven year old sister down to listen to “Keisha’s Song” for the first time, presumably in an attempt to warn her against getting entangled in sexual relationships that could derail her life.\nKeisha’s song, mmm\nMy little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face\nThe day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play\nHowever, despite listening to Keisha’s song and receiving guidance from Kendrick, Kendrick’s sister still ended up getting pregnant as an unmarried teenager. After Kendrick’s sister became pregnant, Kendrick seemed to blame himself for failing to provide enough of a positive influence for her to make different choices in response to her sexual desires as Kendrick detailed on the track “u” from To Pimp a Butterfly.\nWhat can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several\nSituations, I’ll start with your little sister bakin’\nA baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?\nWhere was your antennas?\nWhere was the influence you speak of?\nYou preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her\nI fuckin’ tell you, you fuckin’ failure, you ain’t no leader Moreover, in addition to failing to provide enough guidance to prevent his younger sister from becoming pregnant as a teenager, Kendrick failed to follow his own advice of learning to make wise and exhibit self-control in regard to his sexual desires, as the revelation of his infidelity made clear on Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers.\nSweet Jesus “While I’m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus” \u003e Sweet Jesus The phrase “sweet Jesus” has been used to address Jesur in several well known church songs and hymns. One of the earliest references can be found in an 1861 Roman Catholic hymn called “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus”.\nIn this Sacrament, sweet Jesus,\nThou didst give Thy Flesh and Blood,\nWith Thy soul and God-head also,\nAs our own most precious food. In those context of that hymn, Jesus is described as being “sweet” because of the Roman Catholic conviction that the bread and wine of the communion meal truly become Jesus’s body and blood as Jesus himself declared when he first established the tradition of the communion meal just before his arrest, crucifixion and resurrection.\nNow while they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” And when Jesus had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. -Matthew 26:26-28 Notably, Jesus explained that the wine which becomes his blood is meant to be poured into the mouths of his followers so that their sins could be forgiven. This connects to the story of Jesus forgiving all the sins of the prostitute who cried as she cleaned his feet.\nMoreover, the first verse of “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus” Implied that after receiving the body and blood of the sweet Jesus the correct response is to express a greater degree of love for Jesus.\nYes, dearest Jesus! I believe it,\nAnd Thy presence I adore,\nAnd with all my heart I love Thee,\nMay I love Thee more and more. Similarly, the third verse of “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus” highlights the idea that Jesus conveys his love for sinful humans by offering his sweet body and blood for the forgiveness of their sins.\nBlessed be the love of Jesus\nGiving us His flesh and blood* Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim The Elohim “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e The Elohim In English translations n the original Hebrew texts of the Old Testament section of the Bible, the word “Elohim” is a plural word that is used to refer to a wide category of “spiritual beings” including angels, demons, cherubim, seraphim and even the spirits of dead humans. However, when the text refers to “the Elohim” it is understood to be a reference to the most powerful “Elohim” / spiritual being who created all the other Elohim / spiritual beings, is the only Elohim that humans are supposed to worship and is identified as Yahweh the God of Israel.\nTo distinguish Yahweh as “the Elohim” who is more powerful than all other “Elohim” the biblical authors will sometimes refer to Yahweh as “El Elyon” which means “the Most High [Elohim / God].”\nIt is notable that according to an interview in Billboard magazine, when Kendrick reached out to get Ghostface to rap a verse for “Purple Hearts”, Kendrick specifically told Ghostface to include “the Elohim” in his verse. Ghostface clarified by confirming that “the Elohim” is “the Most High”.\n[Kendrick Lamar and his team] hit my manager Mike. He was like, “Yo, I want you to do this record.”\nWhen he texted me, he said, “Throw ’the Elohim’’[in your rap].”\nI said, “Well, the Elohim is the Most High.”\nAnd Kendrick was like, “Exactly.” Seeing God “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e Seeing God Throughout the Bible the biblical authors frequently emphasize that “the Elohim” / God transcends all creation and cannot be seen in His entirety. However, the biblical authors also highlight a few rare occasions in which a few select people are able to see a partial glimpse of “the Elohim” / God.\nFor instance, in the Old Testament book of Exodus after God freed the Israelites from slavery to the Egyptians, gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and entered into a covenant agreement to be “the Elohim” of the Israel, God invited Moses, the Israelite priests (Aaron, Nadab and Abihu) and seventy ruling elders of the community to come up Mount Sinai where they saw “the Elohim” / God and ate a meal with “the Elohim” / God.\nThen Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself. Yet He did not reach out with His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank.\n-Exodus 24:9-11 Forty days after seeing “the Elohim” / God, as Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving more instructions from God, all the priests and elders along with the rest of the Israelites decided to make an idol so that they could have an elohim who they could see whenever they wanted to see. They then made and worshiped a golden calf idol which broke the first two commandments which had forbidden them from worshipping any Elohim other than Yahweh or making an idol of any Elohim.\nMoses was one of the only leaders who did not worship the golden calf idol. As a result, Moses was the only Israelite leader who was allowed to back up Mount Sinai and see God in an even more glorious glimpse.\n*Then *Moses said, “Please, show me Your glory!”\nAnd Yahweh, the Lord, said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the Yahweh, the Lord. Yahweh, the Lord, further said, “You cannot see My face, for humans shall not see Me and live!”\nThen Yahweh, the Lord, said, “Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock; and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.\"\n-Exodus 33:18-23\nOne of Jesus’s most famous set of teachings is recounted in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel in chapters 5 through 7. This set of teachings is commonly referred to as the “Sermon on the Mount” in reference to the location in which Jesus was teaching. Similar to Moses, Jesus went up a mountain and taught his disciples about how to truly follow God’s commandments. (See the Bible Project “Sermon on the Mount” video series for more details)\nThis set of teachings begin with a set of nine “blessings” (also called “beatitudes” from the Latin beatitudo meaning “fortunate” or “in a happy state of being”). Jesus used these “blessings” to highlight the kinds of people who will receive favorable treatment or blessings from God. One of these nine “blessings” is:\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. This proclamation that the “pure in heart” are the ones who will see God aligns with the stories from Exodus where Moses kept his heart pure from idolatry and was thus able to see God while the priests, ruling elders and the rest of the Israelites were no longer able to see God after they broke God’s commandments by making the golden calf idol.\nThe idea that the “pure in heart” will see God also seems to provide further motivation for Ghostface to “purify” his “D-speeches” so that he can see “the Elohim”.\nNine blessings “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e Nine blessings It might also be notable that the Sermon on the Mount begins with nine blessings and “Purple Hearts” is the ninth track on Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers.\nThe number 9 is often seen as an important and symbolic number within the New Testament and later Christian church tradition. The symbolism of the number 9 is derived from the fact that the number 3 is very significant and 9 is 3 x 3.\nThe significance of the number 3 is first established in the Old Testament. Most notably…\nIn Genesis, God appeared to a pivotal figure named Abraham in the form of 3 angels.\nWhen Jonah was swallowed by the fish he was in the “belly of the beast” for 3 days and 3 nights before he was brought back up to the land of the living. These Old Testament occurrences of the number 3 were picked up by many Judeans in Jesus’s time. Jesus’s followers saw the occurrences as signs which pointed to…\nGod being revealed as “one God in three persons” (God the Father, God the Son-aka Jesus-,and God the Holy Spirit), which early Christians began to refer to as “the Trinity”\nJesus being in the tomb over the course of 3 days Furthermore, many biblical scholars who have closely studied the Sermon on the Mount have noted that the entire structure of the sermon can be seen as smaller 3-part sections that are nested within larger 3-part sections.There’s a great Bible Project “Visual Commentary” video which breaks down these nested 3-part sections.\nThe 9 “blessings” in the opening of the Sermon on the Mount seems to be a great example of this nested 3-part structure.\nConsciously thinking in 3’s naturally leads one to contemplate “the Trinity” of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, which the earliest Christians believed to be the way in with “the Elohim” / God was fully revealed.\nThis is further emphasized in the most ancient liturgies or script for church service, including the current liturgy used in Orthodox churches, which has numerous instances in which something is repeated 3 times with some slight variation.\nMost notably, one hymn or prayer that is featured in almost every Orthodox service says “Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us” and repeats this 3 times. This means that the word “Holy” is said 9 times.\nIn short, using the number 9 seems to be a way that Jesus’s followers train their minds to think in sets of 3’s and thus see the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) as the fundamental reality that orders the entire universe.\nDreams and visions “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e Dreams and visions While it is exceedingly rare for any biblical characters to see God in the normal course of their waking lives, there are a few more examples in which a few characters have dreams or visions in which they see God.\nFor instance, the Old Testament book of Genesis introduces a man named Jacob who will eventually have his name changed to Israel and become the ancestor of all Israelites. At one point during a pivotal period of his life just before he would meet the wives who would give birth to his children, Jacob / Israel had a dream in which he saw Yahweh, the Elohim / God of Israel, standing at the top of a ladder to the heavens, above the angels and all other elohim / spiritual beings.\nThen Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. And he happened upon a particular place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and made it a support for his head, and lay down in that place. And he had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. Then behold, the Lord was standing above it and said, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants.\nThen Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “The Lord is certainly in this place, and I did not know it!” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!”\n-Genesis 28:10-13,16-17 Similarly, many of the prophets among Jacob / Israel’s descendants had visions in which they saw Yahweh, the Elohim / God of Israel, enthroned above all other elohim / spiritual beings. For instance, the book of Prophet Ezekiel begins with Ezekiel seeing a vision of “the Elohim” enthroned as the “Most High” Elohim.\nNow it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. As I looked, behold, a high wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing intermittently and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like gleaming metal in the midst of the fire. And within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form. Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like a dome, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads. Now above the dome that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man. Like the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Yahweh, the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking.\n-Ezekiel 1:1,4-5,22,26,28 In the Old Testament, prophets were typically the only ones who had divine dreams or visions of “the Elohim” / God. However, one particular Old Testament prophet named Joel prophesied that at some point in the future, Yahweh, the Lord, would “pour his Spirit” on all humanity and enable many more people to have divine dreams and visions.\nIt will come about after this\nThat I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity;\nAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nYour old men will have dreams,\nYour young men will see visions.\nAnd even on the male and female servants\nI will pour out My Spirit in those days.\n-Joel 2:28-10 Within the New Testament, Jesus’s disciples declare that Joel’s prophecy is fulfilled during the Jewish holiday of Pentecost when Jesus sends the Holy Spirit (i.e. the third person of “the Trinity”) to fill his disciples with new thoughts and emotions that will allow them truly follow God’s commandments, live “holy” lives that are set apart from the rest of the world, and spread the “Good News” of Jesus’s life, death and resurrection to humans from all nations.\nWhen the day of Pentecost had come, Jesus’s disciples and apostles were all together in one place. And suddenly a noise like a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And tongues that looked like fire appeared to them, distributing themselves, and a tongue rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with different [tongues / languages], as the Spirit was giving them the ability to speak out.\nNow there were Judeans residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together and they were bewildered, because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language. They were amazed and astonished, saying, “Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? We hear them speaking in our own tongues of the mighty deeds of God.”\nAnd they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” But others were jeering and saying, “They are full of sweet wine!”\nBut Peter, taking his stand with the other eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this, and pay attention to my words. For these people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is only the third hour of the day; but this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel: “‘And it shall be in the last days,’ God says,\n‘That I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity;\nAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nAnd your young men will see visions,\nAnd your old men will have dreams;\nAnd even on My male and female servants\nI will pour out My Spirit in those days,\nAnd they will prophesy.”\n-Acts 2:1-7, 11-18 King David, the prophet and adulterer “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e King David/Kendrick, the prophet and adulterer It is notable that Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet going back to as far as the track “Mortal Man” from To Pimp a Butterfly and throughout the album DAMN..\nThroughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick’s role as God’s prophet seems to be in question likely because of his adultery and sexual addiction.\nIn this sense, Kendrick could be compared to the Old Testament King David who was a great leader, a poet, a musician, a prophet and a devoted follower of God yet went on to use his power to commit adultery by secretly forcing his neighbor’s wife to have sex with him and then killing his neighbor after his wife became pregnant through King David’s adultery.\nAfter God sent a prophet to confront King David, King David confessed his sinful behavior and repented. King David also wrote a famous poem about his sinful behavior, need for repentance and a prayer for God not to take God’s Holy Spirit away from David. This poem later became Psalm 51.\nHave mercy on me, God, the Elohim, according to your loyal love.\nAccording to the multitude of your tender mercies,\nblot out my transgressions.\nWash me thoroughly from my inequity.\nCleanse me from my sin\nFor I know my transgressions.\nMy sin is constantly before me.\nAgainst you, and you only, I have sinned,\nand done that which is evil in your sight,\nso you may be proved right when you speak,\nand justified when you judge.\nBehold, I was born in inequity.\nMy mother conceived me in sin.\nBehold, you desire truth in the inward parts.\nYou teach me wisdom in the inmost place.\nPurify me with hyssop oil, and I will be pure.\nWash me, and I will be whiter than snow.\nLet me hear joy and gladness,\nthat the bones which you have broken may rejoice.\nHide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my inequities.\nCreate in me a pure heart, O God, the Elohim.\nRenew a right spirit within me.\nDon’t throw me from your presence,\nand don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.\nRestore to me the joy of your salvation.\nUphold me with a willing spirit.\nThen I will teach transgressors your ways.\nSinners will be converted to you.\nDeliver me from the guilt of bloodshed,\nO God, the Elohim of my salvation.\nMy tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.\nLord, open my lips. My mouth will declare your praise.\nFor you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.\nYou have no pleasure in burnt offering.\nThe sacrifices of God, the Elohim are a broken spirit.\nO God, the Elohim, you will not despise a broken and humbled heart.\n-Psalms 51:1-17 It is notable that on “The Heart Pt. 3” Kendrick has previously rapped about how his rise to fame and success put so much pressure on him that he was compelled to read the story of David and pray to God to keep him from “falling off.”\n‘Cause when the whole world see you as ‘Pac reincarnated\nEnough pressure to make you just open the Book of David\nAnd pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix\n‘Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it’s quite contagious Blurry vision “Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,” \u003e Blurry vision By saying “visions get blurry” Ghostface seems to be indicating that he and also Kendrick may have previously been able to see God more clearly. However, due to their impure thoughts, speech and actions, particularly in regards to “sexual impurity”, Kendrick and Ghostface’s spiritual vision and ability to see “the Elohim” / God has become blurry.\nThis idea of blurry vision also echos St. Paul’s First Letter to the church in Corinth in which St. Paul asserts that as humans living mortal lives in this world our spiritual vision is not clear. Rather we only see spiritual things as if we are looking at an ancient metal mirror which would have been unclear and blurry. However, St. Paul asserts that when the followers of Jesus die, are resurrected, pass through judgement and fully enter into eternal life, they will see clearly as if looking face to face.\nIt is notable that this teaching about seeing unclearly in this mortal life and clearly in the eternal life to come occurs within a larger passage in which St. Paul highlights God-inspired love as the greatest virtue in this mortal life and the eternal life to come while also defining what God-inspired love looks like in practice.\nIf I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don’t have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don’t have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don’t have love, it profits me nothing.\nLove is patient and is kind. Love does not envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails.\nBut where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.\nBut now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love.\n-1 Corinthians 13:1-13 As has been noted elsewhere, love is one of the central themes specifically within the chorus and verses of “Purple Hearts”:\nI know y’all love it when the drugs talkin’, but\nShut the fuck up when you hear love talkin’\n…\nHow’s love when it’s haunting your soul?\n…\nNow, if it’s love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes\nAnd if I feel where your heart can be, you’ll still be a part of me\nI love my, love my (Love my, love my)\nSummer in the storm, I cannot conform\n(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)\nI just might love you still, just think I love me more\nIt ain’t love if you gon’ judge me for my past\nNo, it ain’t love if you ain’t never eat my ass\nIt ain’t love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag It’s light, it’s known to tear retinas in a single gleam Light of God “It’s light, it’s known to tear retinas in a single gleam” \u003e “Light of God Throughout the Bible, the biblical authors use light as a motif that is closely associated with “the Elohim” / God.\nIn the first creation narrative in Genesis 1, the pre-created world is described as being in darkness until “the Elohim” / God commands light to appear as the first act of creation.\nIn the beginning God, the Elohim, created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep water, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.Then God, the Elohim, said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. God, the Elohim, saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.”\n-Genesis 1:1-5 Similarly, in the introduction to St. John’s account of the Gospel, St. John describes Jesus as the “light of humanity” and who “enlightens every human.”\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of humanity. And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it. This was the true Light that, coming into the world, enlightens every human.\n-John 1:1-5,9 Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus taught that he is the “Light of the world.”\nJesus again spoke to the Judeans, saying, “I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.” -John 8:12 In St. John’s First Letter to the whole Church, St. John summarizes the entire message of the Gospel / Good News by saying that God, the Elohim, is light.\nThis is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. Finally, towards the end of his life, St. John had a vision (aka revelation) in which he saw Jesus as the Son of God who would one day bring justice to the patterns of evil in the world once and for all and create a new heaven and a new earth. In St. John’s vision of the new heaven and new earth he sees a new city of Jerusalem coming down from heaven to earth. Moreover, St. John notes that in the new heaven and new earth there will no longer be any night and humans will no longer need the light of lamps or even the light of the sun because Yahweh, the Elohim, (aka the Lord God) will shine light on all humans who have passed through judgement into eternal life.\nThere will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illuminate them; and they will reign forever and ever.\n-Revelation 22:5 It is notable that on “Rich Spirit” Kendrick mentions the concept of the “New Earth” in connection to Ekhart Tolle’s book “A New Earth”, which takes its title from St. John’s vision in the book of Revelation.\nThe New Earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives Tear retinas “It’s light, it’s known to tear retinas in a single gleam” \u003e Tear retinas A retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of an eye that senses light and sends images to the brain.\nIf a retina tears it could lead to vision loss and even blindness. Such tears are most likely to be caused by a mechanical force inside the eye. However, the intense and focused light of a high powered laser can tear retinas.\nHence, while the light of ”the Elohim” / God represents the ultimate good which drives away the darkness, as the most intense and focused light that has existed before creation, the light of “the Elohim” / God can also “tear retinas in a single gleam” and blind humans so that they are no longer able to see any light. St. Paul blinded by the light “It’s light, it’s known to tear retinas in a single gleam” \u003e St. Paul blinded by the light The most famous example of a person being blinded by the light of God / the Elohim occurs in the story of St. Paul’s transformation from being a killer of Christians to being one of the most famous and influential Christians in history as he was largely responsible for spreading Christianity across the Roman Empire.\nPrior to becoming a Christian, St. Paul-who was also known as Saul-was an upstanding member of the Pharisee religious group and was extremely zealous in his commitment to practicing Judaism as it had been practiced by his ancestors.\nSt. Paul never met Jesus during Jesus’s earthly life. However, after Jesus’s death, resurrection and ascension up into the heavens, Paul (who at the time primarily known by his Hebrew name, Saul) was living in Jerusalem when the first church in Jerusalem was rapidly expanding with people who were practicing traditional Judaism but were now also recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, or Christ, the anointed king about whom the Old Testament prophets had prophesied.\nSaul along with the other members of the Pharisee religious group were convinced that the beliefs and practices of Judaism were incompatible with Jesus being recognized as the Messianic, anointed king. Moreover, since Saul and the other Pharisees did not believe that Jesus was God, they were convinced that worshipping Jesus as the Lord and the Son of God was a form of idolatry that deserved to be punished by death under the laws of Judaism that were given to Moses in the Old Testament.\nSaul’s zealous commitment to Judaism as it had been practiced by his ancestors drove him to take on the responsibility of finding any Judeans who were now followers of Jesus, arrest them and bring them to the Judeans’ religious court where they could be imprisoned, tried, condemned and sentenced to death. Saul even got permission to go to the city of Damascus in modern-day Syria in order to hunt down followers of Jesus who had fled from the persecution in Jerusalem.\nAs Saul was traveling on the road to Damascus he saw a light from the heavens which knocked him to the ground and blinded him. He also heard a voice from the heavens which said “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” Saul responded to the voice by asking “Who are You, Lord?” The voice replied by saying, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.”\nThe voice also told Paul to go into the city of Damascus and wait for further instructions. However, Saul was now blind and had to be led into the city by his traveling companion.\nAfter a few days the Lord appeared in a vision to a follower of Jesus who was living in Damascus. The Lord instructed this follower to go to the house where Paul was staying so that Saul could be healed, receive back his sight and become a messenger who would bring the Good News of Jesus’s life, death and resurrection to people of numerous nations around the Mediterranean.\nAfter Saul received back his sight, he was baptized and soon began announcing that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God. As followers of the Pharisee religious group rejected Saul and tried to kill him on numerous occasions, Saul began to announce the Good News to Greek speaking people throughout the Roman Empire and became primarily known by his Greek name, Paul.\nWithin the context of Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Saul/Paul’s to being blinded by the light of God was a perfect example of someone who seemed to be a very noble person but was actually a killer as Kendrick discussed in “Worldwide Steppers.”\nI’m a killer, he’s a killer, she’s a killer, bitch\nWe some killers, walkin’ zombies, tryna scratch that itch\n…\nThe noble person that goes to work and pray like they ‘posed to?\nSlaughter people too, your murder’s just a bit slower At the same time, within the context of “Purple Hearts”, St. Paul is a perfect example of someone who was speaking hateful and murderous threats against God’s people until God shut him up and forced him to listen to the voice of Jesus, the Son of God—a voice which came down from the heavens and taught St. Paul how to truly love others.\nShut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin' Love “Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin’” \u003e Love Here Ghostface echoes the line from hook where Kendrick says “Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin’”. However, instead of saying “hear love talkin’”, Ghostface says “hear His love talkin’”\nWithin the context of this Ghostface’s verse, the pronoun “His” is almost surely a reference to the Most High God, “the Elohim”, who was revealed in visible form by Jesus the anointed king (aka Messiah or Christ) whose feet were anointed by a crying prostitute.\nAs we discussed in the line “It’s light—It’s known to tear retinas in a single gleam”, the idea of someone being told to shut up and listen to God’s love mirrors the story of St. Paul who heard the voice of Jesus speaking from the heavens to turn St. Paul from hatred to love.\nIn the chorus version of this line, the phrase “hear love talkin’” Kendrick seems to be telling us to listen to a personified embodiment of love. Hence, when Ghostface alters the phrase to say “hear His love talking” it seems to imply that God’s love can almost be thought of as a personified embodiment of perfect love.\nNotably, this idea that God being the personified embodiment of perfect love is the same conclusion that St. John makes during his first letter to the entire Church where he teaches that Jesus’s followers should listen to God’s commandment to love each other because “God is love”. Moreover, St. John teaches that God’s love is fully expressed by Jesus, the Son of God, bringing reconciliation between God and sinful humans. Because of this reconciliation, humans who love each other have hope that after they die, they will pass through God’s judgement and into eternal life.\nBeloved, let’s love one another; for love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. By this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the reconciliation for our sins.\nBeloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us. By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us, because He has given to us of His Spirit. We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.\nWhoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because we also are in this world just as He is.\n-1 John 4:7-17 Ghostface seems to have referenced this passage from St. John’s first letter to the Church during an interview with MONTREALITY.\nIt’s a war between God and Devil, man. And the devil is just doing his job so you can’t even get mad at the Devil because that’s what he came to do. But you don’t got to be a follower. If you had a choice to choose what gang you going to go to, I’m going go to the God gang because love always overcomes hate any day and God is love and the Devil is hate. This passage from St. John’s letter to the Church, echoes Jesus’s own teaching that the greatest of God’s commandments is to love God and at the same time to love other humans (i.e. one’s neighbor).\nJesus gave this teaching after one of the experts in the biblical commandments given to Moses in the first section of the Old Testament asked Jesus what the greatest commandment is. Jesus responded by giving two commandments: “Love Yahweh, the Lord, your Elohim” and “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\nAn expert in the law of Moses asked Jesus a question to test Jesus: “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”\nJesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.”\n-Matthew 22:35-40 Jesus implies that these two commandments are simultaneously the greatest commandment because they both command humans to love. Jesus even says that the central message of the entire Old Testament (including the first section called the Torah/Law and the second section called the Prophets) can be summarized with these two commandments to love.\nLater in the album on the track “Auntie Diaries” Kendrick references Jesus’s commandment to “love your neighbor as yourself” when he stands up to criticize a Church pastor who focused on enforcing that someone should follow some of God’s important but lesser commandments while not showing much of a concern for whether he was personally following the greatest commandment.\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic ‘cause the pastor didn’t see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n“Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,” it hurt\nYou the most ‘cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, “Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?” Moreover, on the track “Savior” Kendrick admitted that he struggled to follow Jesus’s commandment to love his neighbors and thus could not be a savior like Jesus.\nThe cat is out the bag, I am not your savior\nI find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors\nEspecially when people got ambiguous favors\nBut they hearts not in it, see, everything’s for the paper To the mind, it’s God’s cypher divine in a small portion, uh Cypher “To the mind, it’s God’s cypher divine in a small portion, uh” \u003e Cypher With this line, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is such a transcendent experience that the human mind cannot experience it in its entirety. However, the human mind can receive a “small portion” of what it experiences as “God’s cypher divine.”\nThe word “cipher” (alternatively spelled “cipher”) has a few distinct meanings including:\nA way to communicate secrets through encoded messages Mathematics The number zero A gathering of freestyling rappers Ghostface seems to be all these meanings simultaneously.\nFirst, within the context of information security and cryptography, a “cypher” is a method of transforming or encoding a message to keep it secret. A cryptography cypher will often have set rules on how to change the unencrypted letters of the input text to be different letters, numbers, words or symbols in the encrypted output text. If someone knows the rules of the cypher, they may be able to “de-cypher” the output text in order to determine the input text.\nOn the surface, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is like hearing an encoded message that one has to decipher to fully understand.\nOn another level, Ghostface also seems to be giving us an de-cyphered message with the words “God’s cypher divine”. Each of these words have special significance within the spiritual offshoot of the Nation of Islam which is known as the Five Percent Nation, and with whom Ghostface Killah and other members of Wu-Tang Clan have been associated through numerous lyrics that reference teachings and concepts from Five Percent Nation.\nOne way that the Five Percent Nation communicates its teaching is through a cypher called Supreme Mathematics in which each digit from 0 to 9 each map to a word and another cypher called the Supreme Alphabet in which each letter from A to Z maps to a particular word.\nFor instance, “A” maps to the word “Allah” (the Arabic word for God). “B” maps to the word “be” or the word “born”. “C” maps to the word “see”. “D” maps to the word “divine”. “E” maps to the word “equality”. “F” maps to the word “father” and “G” maps to the word “God.”\nFurthermore, “O” maps to the word “cypher” comes from an Arabic word which means “zero” and the numeral 0 is a round, circular shape just like the letter “O”.\nHence, the phrase “God’s cypher divine” maps to the letters “G-O-D”, which spells God. Hence, within the Supreme Alphabet, God can be envisioned as the one who conducts a divine cypher.\nAdditionally, the word “cypher” can also refer to a gathering of freestyling rappers. The use of the word “cypher” to describe such a gathering is likely derived from the fact that from the earliest years of hip hop, freestyling rappers would typically stand in a circle and take turns rapping, often using encoded language and references.\nHence, by saying “To the mind, it’s God’s cypher divine”, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is equivalent to listening to God rapping a verse or conveying encoded messages through the verses of the rappers that God has chosen to be in his inner circle.\nProphet “To the mind, it’s God’s cypher divine in a small portion, uh” \u003e Prophet It is notable that Kendrick has depicted himself as a prophet of God, beginning as early as “Moral Man” on To Pimp a Butterfly and continuing throughout DAMN., particularly on the track “DNA.” and “family ties.”\nI freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain’t a prophet ’til they ask you this question:\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n-”Mortal Man”\nAnd Nazareth gonna plead his case\nThe reason my power’s here on earth\nSalute the truth, when the prophet say\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\n-”DNA.”\nI’m not a trending topic, I’m a prophet\nI answer to Metatron and Gabriel\n-”family ties” On Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick did ask God to speak through him on “Worldwide Steppers”.\nWriter’s block for two years, nothin’ moved me\nAsked God to speak through me, that’s what you hearin’ now\nThe voice of yours truly However, throughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick also expresses the idea that he has lost his way and is somehow distant from God.\nI wonder where I lost my way?\nBeen waiting on your call all day\n-”Die Hard”\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\n-”Mother I Sober” Hence, within the overall context of Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, it seems like Ghostface Killah is the rapper who has been chosen to spit a verse as a part of “God’s cypher divine” while Kendrick really needs to “shut the fuck up” and listen to “God’s love talking’” through Ghostface.\nFaded pictures, this global madness need intervention Faded pictures and global madness “Faded pictures, this global madness need intervention” \u003e Faded pictures and global madness Earlier in the verse, Ghostface rapped, “visions get blurry of the Elohim”. Here the blurry, unclear perception of “the Elohim” / God seems to also lead to unclear perceptions of the world due to “faded pictures.” This lack of clarity in the world leads to a state of chaos and “global madness.”\nThe use of the word “madness” seems to indicate some state of psychological distress or other mental health issue. Moreover, within the context of Kendrick’s catalog, the word madness is a clear reference to Kendrick album good kid, m.A.A.d city in which Kendrick depicts the city of Compton as a place that is afflicted with madness due to the effects of relational conflict, violence, drug addiction, generational trauma and other debilitating issues. These depictions of “madness” are most notable in the tracks “good kid”, “m.A.A.d city” and “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.”\nAll I see in this room: 20’s, Xannies and these ‘shrooms\nGrown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane\nSociety?

Most often an “intervention” is initiated by close family members or friends who are very aware of the problematic behavior even as the person with the problematic behavior remains unaware of or resistant to the consequences of their actions. In many cases, those close family members or friends may first consult with a trained mental or behavioral health professional and may recommend specific actions for the person such as starting some form of therapy or entering into a rehabilitation (aka rehab) program.\nThroughout, Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick’s partner, Whitney, seems to be the person who is trying to initiate an intervention in response to Kendrick’s sex addiction even as Kendrick repeatedly denies that he has a problem and initially resists starting therapy or taking any steps to change his behavior.\nI hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime\nWhitney: (Tell them, tell ’em, tell them the truth)\nI hope you find some paradise\nWhitney: (Tell ’em, tell ’em the truth)\nWhitney: (Tell ’em, tell ’em, tell ’em, tell ’em your—)\n-”United in Grief”\nAsk Whitney about my lust addiction\nText messagin’ bitches got my thumbs hurt\n…\nNext time I fucked a white bitch\nWas out in Copenhagen\n​good kid, m.A.A.d city tour\nI flourished on them stages\nWhitney asked did I have a problem\nI said, “I might be racist”\nAncestors watchin’ me fuck was like retaliation\n-”Worldwide Stepper”\nWhitney: You really need some therapy\nKendrick: Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin’ about?\nWhitney: Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck\nKendrick: Shit, everybody stupid\nWhitney: Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody.

And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\n…\nI made it home, seven years of tour, chasin’ manhood\nBut Whitney’s gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could\n…\n[Interlude: Whitney Alford]\nYou did it, I’m proud of you\nYou broke a generational curse\n-”Mother I Sober” Divine intervention “Faded pictures, this global madness need intervention” \u003e Divine intervention By saying “this global madness need intervention”, Ghostface seems to be suggesting that the entire globe as a whole is in a state of psychological distress or “madness” while continuing to remain unaware or in denial of the consequences of its problematic behavior. With the entire world being such a large and all encompassing entity which continues to deny its “madness” and problematic behavior, it would seem that God, the Elohim, is the only one who could initiate a “divine intervention” likely by means of “God’s cypher divine”.\nIndeed, the story of the Gospel as told by St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St. John is a story about God initiating a divine intervention because of God’s love for ”the world”. This idea is clearly stated by Jesus’s own words in St. John’s account of the Gospel\nGod so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him\n-John 3:16-17 It is also worth noting that in 2010 Lecrea, the most famous and influential rapper within the Chritian hip hop subgenre released an album called Rehab which included a track called “Divine Intervention”.\n‘Cause I’ve been missing all the notes\nIn the minor keys and the major ones\nAnd the key to life is coming to the end of it\nAnd embracing Christ\n…\nWe all hanging by a thread cutting at the wires\nIgnorant that all the sin lead to hellfire\nAnd when I yell fire, they tell me false alarm\n‘Cause they don’t smell the smoke and they don’t sense the harm\nSomething worse than the black plague’s coming\nAnd nothing under the sun can save us from it\nThere’s no hope but divine intervention\nAnd Christ saves victims who are dying from addiction\n…\n‘Cause we all dying and we all trying\nTo stay alive but the truth we ain’t all buying\nThose of us who buy it, We’re never bought from\nWe gon’ live free forever in the Savior’s arms\nIt’s all needles in arms full of life’s drugs\nLust, pride, hate, death running through our blood\nNeed a blood donor, need a transfusion\nHe’s over hanging on the cross for your substitution\nSo in conclusion, only one solution\nTrust divine intervention as your resolution Furthermore, within tracklisting of Rehab, “Divine Intervention” comes immediately after a track called “Killa”, which expresses the idea that unchecked lust and sexual impurity will kill a person’s relationships with God and other humans.\nUhh! I know it’s gon’ kill me but I just can’t let it go\nAnd the, taste so appealing it’s got a grip upon my soul\nThese, honey dip lies mesmerize me\nPride’s got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me\nFools walk the path I’m on, never to be seen again\nSippin on seduction while we eatin on some secret sin\n(No one will never know) says the whisper in my ear\nAnd I know I should be over this but I ain’t seein clear\nAnd I ain’t leavin here, unless somebody save me\nWalkin to my grave, lettin evilness enslave me\nEvil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies\nAnd the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind\nHer fabrical fabrication is fuelin my fascination\nWhile I’m intoxicated she starts her assassination\nI’m losin all my honor and my years to the merciless\nGivin all my life away but I’m just so immersed in this (killa)\n…\nBaby this is innocent (killa)\nIt won’t even hurt a little bit (killa)\nI’m only here for your benefit (killa)\nI’m your every wish (killa)\nCome on and let me in (killa)\nBaby this is innocent (killa)\nAnd it won’t even hurt a little bit (killa)\nClose your eyes and let’s get lost tonight (killa)\nIt’ll be alright (killa)\nYou’ll see I’m not a (killa)\n…\nHer feet go down to DEATH, so don’t let her consume you\nEven though her heart is black, her exterior’s beautiful\nShe’ll take yo’ life away, and strip away yo’ joy\nPretends that she gon build you up but she just gon’ destroy you\nMy friends fell low, when they was so high\nGot me runnin scared of myself, no lie\nAnd I know I’m gon’ die, I tried cold turkey\nBut when I’m feelin worthy, Satan’s sure tryin to merk me\nI’m doin myself dirty, flirtin with what’s perverted\nI should follow the word but I guess I’d rather be murdered\n{ahem} Excuse me I mean martyred, cause I’m killin myself\nMy sin conceived a baby, and we gon’ name her Death\nBreath {gasps} taker, she take my breath away\nReplaces it with poison, and I’m so swept away\nI need some prayer today, hope I wake up before they start my wake up\nSomebody make me break up, I’m datin a (killa)\n-”Killa” Kendrick is clearly aware of Lecrae’s music and message. Back in May of 2012 a few months before the release of good kid, m.A.A.d city Kendrick publicly endorsed (aka co-signed) Lecrae while making a brief cameo in Lecrae’s music video for “Church Clothes”.\nLater in 2024, Kendrick’s respect for Lecrea’s faith and commitment to the way of Jesus would become explicitly clear on the track “Watch the Party Die”. On that track Kendrick openly wondering what Lecrae would do if he was in Kendrick’s position while coming into conflict with “lame niggas” and the demonic forces that control the entertainment industry.\nSometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1\nBut I will—\nIt’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword\n…\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do This world’s in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension The Twilight Zone and fifth dimension “This world’s in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension” \u003e The Twilight Zone and fifth dimension The Twilight Zone is a classic anthology TV series in which each episode tells a different science fiction, fantasy, or horror story—usually with a moral twist or psychological suspense. The Twilight Zone series is known for their eerie storytelling, surprise endings, and philosophical themes about human nature, technology, war, and society.\nDuring the first season of The Twilight Zone, each episode began with a video montage and a voiceover which explains that The Twilight Zone is another name for “the fifth dimension.” This “fifth dimension” is referred to the “dimension of imagination” which exists in the “middle ground” in between light and shadows and between all other opposing realities that we typically experience in our normal state of being in this world.\nThere is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man.\nIt is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.\nIt is the middle ground between light and shadow,\nbetween science and superstition,\nand it lies between the pit of man’s fears\nand the summit of his knowledge.\nThis is the dimension of imagination.\nIt is an area which we call\nThe Twilight Zone. The psychological, philosophical and moral aspects of The Twilight Zone stories are very similar in scope to stories that Kendrick is telling throughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers.\nBy saying that “this world’s in The Twilight Zone”, Ghostface seems to be suggesting that the “global madness” that has recently become more apparent, particular in the wake of Covid-19 and the global pandemic, is really an indication that the sane and peaceful existence that most of us are used to in America and the rest of the modern West is really a facade. The true reality of the world is far more strange, dangerous, and unsettling than most of us are willing or able to comprehend.\nBy saying “this is the fifth dimension” Ghostface also seems to be emphasizing the idea that this world exists in the unsettled space in between the light of God and the satanic shadows of sin. Hence as we live our lives in this world we are faced with moral choices to either move towards the light of God or towards the satanic shadows of sin.\nAt the same time within the context of Ghostface’s verse we should note that the word “intervention” is derived from the Latin word “interveniō” which means “to come between.”\nHence, God the Father has initiated a divine intervention by sending Jesus, the Son of God, into the world, into the in-between space of the fifth dimension in order to shine God’s light upon every human and give them an opportunity to walk in the light of life.\nGod, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission Sports game intermission “God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission” \u003e Sports game intermission Here Ghostface seems to depict God as a referee who blows a whistle to stop or pause a sports game, particularly just before break or intermission between two segments of a sports game, such as the first and second half of a football game.\nWithin this metaphor of God being a referee, the game can be seen as a metaphor for the entirety of human existence within this world.\nThis idea of God blowing a whistle to signal an intermission between two halves of a game also continues the motif of God initiating an intervention and sending Jesus as the Son of God into the “in-between” space of the fifth dimension.\nBy saying “we need an intermission”, Ghostface seems playing the role of a metaphorical commentator who sees that the game has become chaotic and out of control or a metaphorical coach who sees that his team has lost all momentum and composure and needs an intermission to calm down, refocus, listen to the coach’s instruction and make several strategic adjustments.\nIt is also notable that years after the release of Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick would go on to perform as the headline musical act during the halftime intermission of the 2025 National Football League Superbowl game. Moreover, Kendrick’s entire performance was built around the concept of Kendrick’s life being a game.\nThis concept of Kendrick’s life being a game was established in the promotional advertising spots which encouraged audiences to “Catch Kendrick Lamar at the top of his game in the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show.”\nThe Halftime Show performance opened with Samuel L. Jackson dressed as “Uncle Sam” while saying “Salutations, it’s your Uncle Sam, and this is the great American game.”\nThe performance took place on the football field with Kendirck going between four stages that were in the square, x, triangle and circle buttons from a PlayStation controller. The performance also ended with a shot of lights in the stands which spelled out the words “GAME OVER” in reference to a video game where the player has lost all of their lives.\nI previously discussed the layers of meaning of Kendrick “playing the game” during an interview with the Yale Center for Faith \u0026 Culture.\nAlbum intermission “God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission” \u003e Album intermission In is also notable that Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers is divided into two discs, each with nine tracks. The first disc is called Big Steppers and the second disc is titled Mr. Morale. As track 9 of Disc 1, the end of “Purple Hearts” marks the intermission between the two halves of the album.\nThis album intermission is particularly noticeable if you listen to the album on vinyl. On vinyl, the album is laid out on two separate vinyl records, which means that if we want to listen to the entire album we will “need an intermission” to allow someone to take the first record off The record player and put the second record on the record player.

Love coming “in between” these opposing inclinations to kill enemies or kill vices also reminds of God sending Jesus as the Son of God to come into this world, which is the in-between space of the fifth dimension.\nSince, St. John and Ghostface have both testified to the idea that “God is love” we can also hear the word “love” as a direct address which could alternatively be heard as a prayer spoken to God (i.e. “God, we killin’ greed, we killin’ homelessness”).\nAnd I don’t give a fuck about this land, I want ownership subsection “And I don’t give a fuck about this land, I want ownership” \u003e subsection Bow your head for just God’s sake Bow your head to pray “Bow your head for just God’s sake” \u003e Bow your head to pray Within the context of Christianity and other spiritual traditions, individuals will bow their heads in order to humble themselves and show respect for God’s greatness, particularly someone who is going to pray.\nGhostface seems to be addressing this imperative statement directly to Kendrick, Whitney and the entire audience. Ghostface thus seems to be playing the role of a pastor or priest who seeks to reconnect his people with God through prayer.

<ul>
<li>In science fiction and fantasy media, telekinesis refers to the ability to move or manipulate objects with the mind or thoughts and without any physical interaction. Within the context of a pivotal rap verse, Ghostface seems to be saying that he is about to move us emotionally using the thoughts that are coming from his mind.</li>
</ul>

      <h4 id="telekinesis-im-purifying-these-d-speeches--d-speeches">&ldquo;Telekinesis, I&rsquo;m purifying these D speeches&rdquo; &gt; D speeches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#telekinesis-im-purifying-these-d-speeches--d-speeches">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In street culture, “D” can be short for “dope” or “drug”. For example the term “d boys” is short for “dope boys”, which refers to drug dealers. In numerous songs and interviews, Ghostface has rapped and talked about his past experience as a drug dealer. Hence, “D speeches” could be a reference to rap verses and other speech which glorifies drug dealing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that &ldquo;D speeches&rdquo; refers to Ghostface talking about drugs would connect to the lyrics of the hook where Kendrick says &ldquo;I know y&rsquo;all love it when the drugs talkin'&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>“Purifying” refers to the act of making something pure or clean by removing substances that are unwanted or that differ from the main substance.<br>
 </li>
<li>Within the theme of drug dealing, there are various processes through which a recreational drug could be purified so that the drug is more potent.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, given the Christian spiritual themes that are woven throughout Ghostface’s verse, it seems more notable that making humans, places and objects “pure” or “clean” is a central theme throughout the Bible.<br>
 </li>
<li>Within the biblical context, particularly within the Old Testament, something that is “impure” is not allowed to enter God’s temple or come near to anything that is set apart (or holy) to be used for any purpose that is related to the worship of God. Moreover, if an “impure” human, place, or object touches another human, place or object that is “pure”, the previously pure object becomes “impure.”<br>
 </li>
<li>In some cases, humans, places and objects in the biblical narratives can become impure because they come into contact with physical things such as blood, skin diseases or certain animals. However, on a deeper level, humans, places and objects can become impure because of human words or actions that are unrighteous, unjust, immoral, or contrary to God&rsquo;s commandments. (See the Bible Project videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9vn5UvsHvM">“Holiness”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/G_OlRWGLdnw?si=kU0yzkdqUS53SHjk">“Atonement &amp; Purification”</a>)<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, by saying “I’m purifying these D speeches”, Ghostface seems to be expressing his intention to make his rap verses and speeches pure by removing everything that is unrighteous, unjust, immoral or contrary to God’s commandments. Moroever, by “purifying his D speeches”, Ghostface seems to be preparing himself for an opportunity to come near to God. Within the context of this verse, coming near to God seems to be possible by coming “to the feet of the sweet Jesus” who is identified as the Son of God.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R7fYCz1Ucs&amp;t=2882s">2024 interview on the “Touré Show”</a>, Ghostface discussed how “cussing” or speaking any profanity is a sin which he needs to stop doing and ask for forgiveness whenever he does use profanity in his speeches.<br>
 
<ul>
<li><em>You got to look at your life right now and basically just try to do good deeds. Just do good. Listen—<strong>me cussing is a sin. Don&rsquo;t look at it like its a bullshit sin. These are spells that we throwing around every time you cuss. We&rsquo;re not supposed to even say that. I&rsquo;m about the cuss again but I ask for forgiveness.</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, in a 2022 interview with Fact Magazine, Ghostface discussed his desire to release a rap album about God.<br>
 
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I wanna rhyme about God, I wanna do a God album, a positive album so the kids and everybody will understand what’s going on.</strong> I want to tell what’s going on through my eyes. I don’t wanna give too many of my ideas away because people just be taking them. <strong>Feed the poor people, feed the animals, that’s one of the main reasons I’m here. God put me here to teach people and to lead people to his direction. I’m not a Christian, I’m a Muslim but God is one. I just believe in the Most High. I know what my duty is</strong>.</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The image of Ghostface Killah crying builds on the theme of crying that has already een established throughout the first half of Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The album begins with the song &ldquo;United in Grief&rdquo; in which featured a hook in which Kendrick repeatedly says &ldquo;I grieve different&rdquo; in between verses before finally saying &ldquo;Everybody grieves different&rdquo; at the end of the track. The final verse of &ldquo;United in Grief&rdquo; also ends with Kendrick saying &ldquo;the money wiping the tears away&rdquo; in reference to his attempts to deal with his grief through expensive, luxury cars, jewelry, houses, and guns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most notably, &ldquo;Purple Hearts&rdquo; comes directly after the track &ldquo;We Cry Together&rdquo;, in which Kendrick seems to acknowledge the shared experience of a &ldquo;pain body&rdquo; that leads to a cycle of conflicts in romantic relationships, including within Kendrick&rsquo;s relationship with Whitney.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that “Purple Hearts” comes right after “We Cry Together” this line seems to suggest that intense conflict between Kendrick and Whitney or any two individuals in a marriage or mating relationship is really a cry for help—a cry is meant to lead both individuals to humble themselves at the feet of Jesus.<br>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Clean the feet of Jesus</summary>
    
      <h4 id="while-im-crying-i-clean-the-feet-of-the-sweet-jesus--clean-the-feet-of-jesus">&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus&rdquo; &gt; Clean the feet of Jesus<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#while-im-crying-i-clean-the-feet-of-the-sweet-jesus--clean-the-feet-of-jesus">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The image of someone crying while cleaning Jesus&rsquo;s feet is a clear reference to the story of the prostitute who met Jesus in a St. Luke&rsquo;s account of the Gospel in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207%3A36-50&amp;version=NASB">Luke 7:36-50</a>.<br>
 </li>
<li>In that story, Jesus went to eat at the house of a man named Simon who was an upstanding member of an influential religious leadership group called the Pharisees. At this point in the Gospel narrative, word had spread throughout the region that Jesus was a prophet who had the power to heal people, free people where were previously under the control of demons, forgive people of their sins, and reconnect people to God. Moreover, Jesus had been creating a great deal of controversy among the judgemental members of the Pharisee religious group as he was welcoming &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; into his community of followers and giving them the opportunity to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; by turning away from their sinful behavior.<br>
 </li>
<li>News about Jesus eating at the religious leader&rsquo;s house came to the attention of a woman who was notorious for being a &ldquo;sinner&rdquo;, which in the context of the Gospel accounts would seem to indicate that she was a prostitute. Despite the societal shame of being known as a prostitute and sinner, this particular woman took an expensive container of &ldquo;sweet-smelling&rdquo; perfume, went to the religious leader&rsquo;s house. When she got to the house, the woman showed a tremendous amount of contrition and humility as she cried so much that she was able to use her tears to wet Jesus&rsquo;s dusty feet. She then used her own hair to wipe Jesus&rsquo;s feet. Finally, she showed a tremendous amount of honor towards Jesus by kissing Jesus&rsquo;s feet and pouring the &ldquo;sweet-smelling&rdquo; perfumed oil on Jesus&rsquo;s feet.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that the perfume was likely purchased with her earnings as a prostitute. Moreover, instead of pouring out the perfumed oil on Jesus’s feet she could have alternatively used the sweet smelling oil to attract more clients to her prostitution. Hence, the very act of using the perfume to anoint Jesus&rsquo;s feet rather than putting it on herself was an act of turning away from her sinful behavior and turning towards God.<br>
 </li>
<li>Simon, judgemental Pharisee, immediately concluded that Jesus must not be a true prophet from God because he allowed himself to be associated with and even touched by someone who was a notorious sinner. Within the spiritual practices that were introduced in the Old Testament, someone who sinned as much as a prostitute was clearly considered “impure” and anyone who this “impure” woman touched would also be considered “impure.”<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus was well aware of Simon&rsquo;s conclusion and in response told an allegorical parable story, about two debtors who owed money to the same lender and were both unable to pay the money back. One debtor would have to work for almost a year and a half to pay back his debts. The other debtor would only have to work about a month and a half to pay back his debts. Within their society, the two debtors likely would have been sold as slaves or sent to a debtors prison. However, rather than enforce this consequence, the lender graciously decided to forgive both of the debtors of all their debts.<br>
 </li>
<li>As a follow up question, Jesus asked which of the debtors would love the lender more. The obvious answer was that the debtor who had a larger debt to forgive would show more love to the lender.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus used the story of this parable as a metaphor to illustrate the difference between the prostitute and the upstanding member of the religious group.<br>
 </li>
<li>Much like the debtor who owed a year and half’s worth of wages, the prostitute was convinced that she had a greater debt to society because she had sinned and distanced herself from God to a greater degree than those around her. Thus, because Jesus had proven to be someone who was willing to offer God&rsquo;s forgiveness regardless of how much she had sinned, she was filled with an overwhelming amount of love for Jesus.<br>
 </li>
<li>The prostitute expressed this love by humbling herself, cleaning Jesus&rsquo;s feet, and offering oil that would have been very valuable and precious to her. In response, Jesus declared that all her sins were forgiven “because she loved so much,” which effectively meant that the former prostitute was now considered to be “pure” in the eyes of God.<br>
 </li>
<li>In contrast, the upstanding member of the religious group did not think that he had sinned very much and thus did not value or appreciate Jesus’s offer of forgiveness and did not show much evidence of loving Jesus or even loving God. It naturally follows that this man’s sins may not be forgiven in the future because he does not love very much.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The story of the prostitute who cried as she cleaned Jesus’s feet has numerous parallels to the state in which Kendrick finds himself throughout Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much like the prostitute, Kendrick’s experience of living in poverty eventually led him to a degree of sexual promiscuity which was destructive to his relationships and caused him to distance himself from God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the album, Kendrick seems to be searching for God so that he can ask whether his sins can be forgiven. This is stated most explicitly on “Mother I Sober” where Kendrick raps:<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where&rsquo;s my faith? <strong>Told you I was Christian, but just not today</strong><br>
I transformed, <strong>prayin&rsquo; to the trees, God is taking shape</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Whitney&rsquo;s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen<br>
<strong>Askin&rsquo; God, &ldquo;Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus declares that the prostitute’s choice to clean his feet is an act that clearly demonstrates the love in her heart. This connects to a larger theme across the album where Kendrick repeatedly questions what true love really is.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>This ain&rsquo;t Monopoly, <strong>watchin&rsquo; for love, this ain&rsquo;t monogamy</strong>, y&rsquo;all gettin&rsquo; fucked</em><br>
-“N95”<br>
  </li>
<li><em>Do you love me? Do you trust me?<br>
Can I trust you? Don&rsquo;t judge me</em><br>
-“Die Hard”<br>
  </li>
<li><em>Early mornin&rsquo; wake-ups (Wake-ups), practicin&rsquo; on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)<br>
<strong>Tough love</strong> (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)<br>
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)<br>
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser<br>

-”Father Time”<br>
  </li>
<li><em>More power to ya, <strong>love &rsquo;em from a distance</strong></em><br>
-“Rich Spirit”<br>
  </li>
<li><em>Now, <strong>if it&rsquo;s love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes</strong>, sometimes<br>
And if I feel where your heart can be, you&rsquo;ll still be a part of me<br>

Summer in the storm, I cannot conform<br>
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)<br>
<strong>I just might love you still, just think I love me more<br>
It ain&rsquo;t love if you gon&rsquo; judge me for my past<br>
No, it ain&rsquo;t love if you ain&rsquo;t never eat my ass<br>
It ain&rsquo;t love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag</strong><br>
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m anti-everyone before this mask</em><br>
-“Purple Hearts”<br>
  </li>
<li><em>You walk around like everything is in control<br>

The turnaround is life or death, but you don&rsquo;t mind<br>
Go out the way to say you made the compromise<br>
<strong>That&rsquo;s what I call love</strong><br>
…<br>
But the time it&rsquo;ll come to not be there when somebody needs you<br>
You say no and all you&rsquo;ve done gives them amnesia<br>
<strong>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned, love can change with thе seasons</strong><br>

  </li>
<li><em>You said, &ldquo;Kendrick, ain&rsquo;t no room for contradiction<br>

  <br>
<em><strong>I realized true love&rsquo;s not savin&rsquo; face<br>
But unconditional</strong></em><br>
-“Mirror”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much like Jesus’s critique of the upstanding member of the religious group, Kendrick critiques members of Christian groups who do not seem to truly love the people around them, particularly on the track “Auntie Diaries”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Demetrius is Mary-Ann now<br>
<strong>Remember church, Easter Sunday?</strong><br>
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith<br>
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight<br>
Which I found ironic &lsquo;cause <strong>the pastor didn&rsquo;t see him the same</strong><br>
He said my cousin was going through some things<br>
<strong>He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination<br>
And Demetrius was to blame</strong><br>
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman<br>
Wondering if God still call you a decent man<br>
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint<br>
Until <strong>he singled you out to prove his point</strong>, saying<br>
&ldquo;Demetrius is Mary-Ann now<br>
Church, his auntie is a man now,&rdquo; it hurt<br>
You the most &lsquo;cause your belief was close to his words<br>
<strong>Forcing me to stand now<br>
I said, &ldquo;Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?”</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is fairly ironic that Kendrick is implicitly being compared to a prostitute because Kendrick’s 2011 album <em>Section.80</em> includes a track called “Keisha’s Song” in which Kendrick tells the story of a local prostitute who continued to endure the hazardous conditions of sex worker in Compton because “she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner’s redemption.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>She suddenly realize she&rsquo;ll never escape the allure</strong><br>
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction<br>
At first, it became a practice, but <strong>now she&rsquo;s numb to it<br>
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it<br>
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner&rsquo;s redemption, that sounds foolish</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tragically, Keisha’s story ends with her getting stabbed to death by a client.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keisha rushing to that<br>
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked<br>
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where<br>
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat<br>
Then <strong>caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After recounting Keisha’s story, Kendrick also recounts the moment after he finished recording the song when he sat his eleven year old  sister down to listen to “Keisha’s Song” for the first time, presumably in an attempt to warn her against getting entangled in sexual relationships that could derail her life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keisha&rsquo;s song, mmm<br>
<strong>My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face<br>
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, despite listening to Keisha’s song and receiving guidance from Kendrick, Kendrick’s sister still ended up getting pregnant as an unmarried teenager. After Kendrick’s sister became pregnant, Kendrick seemed to blame himself for failing to provide enough of a positive influence for her to make different choices in response to her sexual desires as Kendrick detailed on the track “u” from <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several<br>
Situations, I&rsquo;ll start with <strong>your little sister bakin&rsquo;<br>
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?<br>
Where was your antennas?<br>
Where was the influence you speak of?<br>
You preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her<br>
I fuckin&rsquo; tell you, you fuckin&rsquo; failure, you ain&rsquo;t no leader</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, in addition to failing to provide enough guidance to prevent his younger sister from becoming pregnant as a teenager, Kendrick failed to follow his own advice of learning to make wise and exhibit self-control in regard to his sexual desires, as the revelation of his infidelity made clear on Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “sweet Jesus” has been used to address Jesur in several well known church songs and hymns. One of the earliest references can be found in an 1861 Roman Catholic hymn called “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In this Sacrament, <strong>sweet Jesus</strong>,<br>
Thou didst <strong>give Thy Flesh and Blood</strong>,<br>
With Thy soul and God-head also,<br>
As our own <strong>most precious food</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In those context of that hymn, Jesus is described as being “sweet” because of the Roman Catholic conviction that the bread and wine of the communion meal truly become Jesus’s body and blood as Jesus himself declared when he first established the tradition of the communion meal just before his arrest, crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now while they were eating, <strong>Jesus took some bread</strong>, and after a blessing, He broke it and <strong>gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.”</strong> And when Jesus had <strong>taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.</strong></em>
-Matthew 26:26-28</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Notably, Jesus explained that the wine which becomes his blood is meant to be poured into the mouths of his followers so that their sins could be forgiven. This connects to the story of Jesus forgiving all the sins of the prostitute who cried as she cleaned his feet.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, the first verse of “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus” Implied that after receiving the body and blood of the sweet Jesus the correct response is to express a greater degree of love for Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, dearest Jesus! I believe it,<br>
And <strong>Thy presence I adore,<br>
And with all my heart I love Thee,<br>
May I love Thee more and more</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, the third verse of “In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus” highlights the idea that Jesus conveys his love for sinful humans by offering his sweet body and blood for the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessed be the love of Jesus<br>
Giving us His flesh and blood</strong>*</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>In English translations n the original Hebrew texts of the Old Testament section of the Bible, the word “Elohim” is a plural word that is used to refer to a wide category of “spiritual beings” including angels, demons, cherubim, seraphim and even the spirits of dead humans. However, when the text refers to “the Elohim” it is understood to be a reference to the most powerful “Elohim” / spiritual being who created all the other Elohim / spiritual beings, is the only Elohim that humans are supposed to worship and is identified as Yahweh the God of Israel.<br>
 </li>
<li>To distinguish Yahweh as “the Elohim” who is more powerful than all other “Elohim” the biblical authors will sometimes refer to Yahweh as “El Elyon” which means “the Most High [Elohim / God].”<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that according to an <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/ghostface-killah-kendrick-lamar-purple-hearts-interview-1235116525/">interview in Billboard magazine</a>, when Kendrick reached out to get Ghostface to rap a verse for “Purple Hearts”, Kendrick specifically told Ghostface to include “the Elohim” in his verse. Ghostface clarified by confirming that “the Elohim” is “the Most High”.<br>
 
<ul>
<li><em>[Kendrick Lamar and his team] hit my manager Mike. He was like, &ldquo;Yo, I want you to do this record.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
When he texted me, he said, &ldquo;Throw &rsquo;the Elohim’&rsquo;[in your rap].&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
I said, &ldquo;Well, the Elohim is the Most High.&rdquo;<br>

      <h4 id="dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--seeing-god">&ldquo;Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,&rdquo; &gt; Seeing God<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--seeing-god">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Bible the biblical authors frequently emphasize that “the Elohim” / God transcends all creation and cannot be seen in His entirety. However, the biblical authors also highlight a few rare occasions in which a few select people are able to see a partial glimpse of “the Elohim” / God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, in the Old Testament book of Exodus after God freed the Israelites from slavery to the Egyptians, gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and entered into a covenant agreement to be “the Elohim” of the Israel, God invited Moses, the Israelite priests (Aaron, Nadab and Abihu) and seventy ruling elders of the community to come up Mount Sinai where they saw “the Elohim” / God and ate a meal with “the Elohim” / God.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself. Yet He did not reach out with His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank.</em><br>
-Exodus 24:9-11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forty days after seeing “the Elohim” / God, as Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving more instructions from God, all the priests and elders along with the rest of the Israelites decided to make an idol so that they could have an elohim who they could see whenever they wanted to see. They then made and worshiped a golden calf idol which broke the first two commandments which had forbidden them from worshipping any Elohim other than Yahweh or making an idol of any Elohim.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moses was one of the only leaders who did not worship the golden calf idol. As a result, Moses was the only Israelite leader who was allowed to back up Mount Sinai and see God in an even more glorious glimpse.</p>
<ul>
<li>*Then *<em>Moses said, “Please, <strong>show me Your glory!”</strong><br>
  <br>
And <strong>Yahweh, the Lord, said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you</strong>, and will proclaim the name of the Yahweh, the Lord. Yahweh, the Lord, further said, “You cannot see My face, for humans shall not see Me and live!”<br>
  <br>
Then Yahweh, the Lord, said, “Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock; and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away and <strong>you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen</strong>.&quot;</em><br>
  <br>
-Exodus 33:18-23<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of Jesus’s most famous set of teachings is recounted in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7&amp;version=NASB">chapters 5 through 7</a>. This set of teachings is commonly referred to as the “Sermon on the Mount” in reference to the location in which Jesus was teaching. Similar to Moses, Jesus went up a mountain and taught his disciples about how to truly follow God’s commandments. (See the Bible Project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH0Szn1yYNefD9pHcnyRivKRGpYGc2yfB">“Sermon on the Mount” video series</a> for more details)<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This set of teachings begin with a set of nine “blessings” (also called “beatitudes” from the Latin beatitudo meaning “fortunate” or “in a happy state of being”). Jesus used these “blessings” to highlight the kinds of people who will receive favorable treatment or blessings from God. One of these nine “blessings” is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This proclamation that the “pure in heart” are the ones who will see God aligns with the stories from Exodus where Moses kept his heart pure from idolatry and was thus able to see God while the priests, ruling elders and the rest of the Israelites were no longer able to see God after they broke God’s commandments by making the golden calf idol.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that the “pure in heart” will see God also seems to provide further motivation for Ghostface to “purify” his “D-speeches” so that he can see “the Elohim”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It might also be notable that the Sermon on the Mount begins with nine blessings and “Purple Hearts” is the ninth track on Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number 9 is often seen as an important and symbolic number within the New Testament and later Christian church tradition. The symbolism of the number 9 is derived from the fact that the number 3 is very significant and 9 is 3 x 3.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The significance of the number 3 is first established in the Old Testament. Most notably…<br>
 </p>
<ol>
<li>In Genesis, God appeared to a pivotal figure named Abraham in the form of 3 angels.<br>
 </li>
<li>When Jonah was swallowed by the fish he was in the “belly of the beast” for 3 days and 3 nights before he was brought back up to the land of the living.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Old Testament occurrences of the number 3 were picked up by many Judeans in Jesus’s time. Jesus’s followers saw the occurrences as signs which pointed to…<br>
 </p>
<ol>
<li>God being revealed as “one God in three persons” (God the Father, God the Son-aka Jesus-,and God the Holy Spirit), which early Christians began to refer to as “the Trinity”<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus being in the tomb over the course of 3 days</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, many biblical scholars who have closely studied the Sermon on the Mount have noted that the entire structure of the sermon can be seen as smaller 3-part sections that are nested within larger 3-part sections.There’s a great Bible Project <a href="https://youtu.be/ajwehw_AT0s">“Visual Commentary” video</a> which breaks down these nested 3-part sections.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 9 “blessings” in the opening of the Sermon on the Mount seems to be a great example of this nested 3-part structure.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciously thinking in 3’s naturally leads one to contemplate “the Trinity” of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, which the earliest Christians believed to be the way in with “the Elohim” / God was fully revealed.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is further emphasized in the most ancient liturgies or script for church service, including the current liturgy used in Orthodox churches, which has numerous instances in which something is repeated 3 times with some slight variation.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most notably, one hymn or prayer that is featured in almost every Orthodox service says “Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us” and repeats this 3 times. This means that the word “Holy” is said 9 times.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, using the number 9 seems to be a way that Jesus’s followers train their minds to think in sets of 3’s and thus see the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) as the fundamental reality that orders the entire universe.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Dreams and visions</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--dreams-and-visions">&ldquo;Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,&rdquo; &gt; Dreams and visions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--dreams-and-visions">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While it is exceedingly rare for any biblical characters to see God in the normal course of their waking lives, there are a few more examples in which a few characters have dreams or visions in which they see God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, the Old Testament book of Genesis introduces a man named Jacob who will eventually have his name changed to Israel and become the ancestor of all Israelites. At one point during a pivotal period of his life just before he would meet the wives who would give birth to his children, Jacob / Israel had a dream in which he saw Yahweh, the Elohim / God of Israel, standing at the top of a ladder to the heavens, above the angels and all other elohim / spiritual beings.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then <strong>Jacob</strong> departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. And he happened upon a particular place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and made it a support for his head, and lay down in that place. And <strong>he had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. Then behold, the Lord was standing above it and said, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham</strong> and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants.<br>
  <br>
Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “The Lord is certainly in this place, and I did not know it!” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!”</em><br>
 <br>
-Genesis 28:10-13,16-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, many of the prophets among Jacob / Israel’s descendants had visions in which they saw Yahweh, the Elohim / God of Israel, enthroned above all other elohim / spiritual beings. For instance, the book of Prophet Ezekiel begins with Ezekiel seeing a vision of “the Elohim” enthroned as the “Most High” Elohim.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, <strong>the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God</strong>. As I looked, behold, a high wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing intermittently and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like gleaming metal in the midst of the fire. And within it <strong>there were figures resembling four living beings</strong>. And this was their appearance: they had human form. Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like a dome, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads. Now <strong>above the dome that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne</strong>, like lapis lazuli in appearance; <strong>and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man. Like the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Yahweh, the Lord.</strong> And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking.</em><br>
 <br>
-Ezekiel 1:1,4-5,22,26,28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Old Testament, prophets were typically the only ones who had divine dreams or visions of “the Elohim” / God. However, one particular Old Testament prophet named Joel prophesied that at some point in the future, Yahweh, the Lord, would “pour his Spirit” on all humanity and enable many more people to have divine dreams and visions.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It will come about after this<br>
That <strong>I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity;<br>
And your sons and your daughters will prophesy,<br>
Your old men will have dreams,<br>
Your young men will see visions</strong>.<br>
And even on the male and female servants<br>
<strong>I will pour out My Spirit in those days</strong>.</em><br>
-Joel 2:28-10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the New Testament, Jesus’s disciples declare that Joel’s prophecy is fulfilled during the Jewish holiday of Pentecost when Jesus sends the Holy Spirit (i.e. the third person of “the Trinity”) to fill his disciples with new thoughts and emotions that will allow them truly follow God’s commandments, live “holy” lives that are set apart from the rest of the world, and spread the “Good News” of Jesus’s life, death and resurrection to humans from all nations.<br>
  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>When <strong>the day of Pentecost</strong> had come, <strong>Jesus’s disciples and apostles</strong> were all together in one place. And suddenly a noise like a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And tongues that looked like fire appeared to them, distributing themselves, and a tongue rested on each one of them. And <strong>they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with different [tongues / languages], as the Spirit was giving them the ability to speak out</strong>.<br>
  <br>
Now <strong>there were Judeans residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven</strong>. And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together and they were bewildered, because <strong>each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language. They were amazed and astonished</strong>, saying, “Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? We hear them speaking in our own tongues of the mighty deeds of God.”<br>
  <br>
And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” But others were jeering and saying, “They are full of sweet wine!”<br>
  <br>
But Peter, taking his stand with the other eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this, and pay attention to my words. For these people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is only the third hour of the day; but <strong>this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel</strong>:
  <br>
&ldquo;‘And it shall be in the last days,’ God says,<br>
‘That <strong>I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity;<br>
And your sons and your daughters will prophesy,<br>
And your young men will see visions,<br>
And your old men will have dreams;</strong><br>
And even on My male and female servants<br>
<strong>I will pour out My Spirit in those days,<br>
And they will prophesy</strong>.&rdquo;</em><br>
  <br>
-Acts 2:1-7, 11-18</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet going back to as far as the track “Mortal Man” from To Pimp a Butterfly and throughout the album <em>DAMN.</em>.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Kendrick’s role as God’s prophet seems to be in question likely because of his adultery and sexual addiction.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this sense, Kendrick could be compared to the Old Testament King David who was a great leader, a poet, a musician, a prophet and a devoted follower of God yet went on to use his power to commit adultery by secretly forcing his neighbor’s wife to have sex with him and then killing his neighbor after his wife became pregnant through King David’s adultery.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After God sent a prophet to confront King David, King David confessed his sinful behavior and repented. King David also wrote a famous poem about his sinful behavior, need for repentance and a prayer for God not to take God’s Holy Spirit away from David. This poem later became Psalm 51.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Have mercy on me, God, the Elohim, according to your loyal love</strong>.<br>
According to the multitude of your tender mercies,<br>
blot out my transgressions.<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my inequity.<br>
<strong>Cleanse me from my sin<br>
For I know my transgressions.<br>
My sin is constantly before me.<br>
Against you, and you only, I have sinned,<br>
and done that which is evil in your sight</strong>,<br>
so you may be proved right when you speak,<br>
and justified when you judge.<br>
Behold, I was born in inequity.<br>
<strong>My mother conceived me in sin.</strong><br>
Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.<br>
You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.<br>
<strong>Purify me with hyssop oil, and I will be pure</strong>.<br>
Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.<br>
Let me hear joy and gladness,<br>
that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.<br>
<strong>Hide your face from my sins</strong>, and blot out all of my inequities.<br>
<strong>Create in me a pure heart, O God, the Elohim.<br>
Renew a right spirit within me</strong>.<br>
Don’t throw me from your presence,<br>
and <strong>don’t take your Holy Spirit from me</strong>.<br>
Restore to me the joy of your salvation.<br>
<strong>Uphold me with a willing spirit</strong>.<br>
Then I will teach transgressors your ways.<br>
<strong>Sinners will be converted to you</strong>.<br>
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed,<br>
O God, the Elohim of my salvation.<br>
My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.<br>
Lord, open my lips. My mouth will declare your praise.<br>
For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.<br>
You have no pleasure in burnt offering.<br>
The sacrifices of God, the Elohim are a broken spirit.<br>
<strong>O God, the Elohim, you will not despise a broken and humbled heart</strong>.</em><br>
-Psalms 51:1-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on “The Heart Pt. 3” Kendrick has previously rapped about how his rise to fame and success put so much pressure on him that he was compelled to read the story of David and pray to God to keep him from “falling off.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lsquo;Cause when the whole world see you as &lsquo;Pac reincarnated<br>
<strong>Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David<br>
And pray to God that you make it</strong> or live your life in The Matrix<br>
<strong>&lsquo;Cause falling off is a sickness</strong>—I heard that it&rsquo;s quite contagious</em></li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Blurry vision</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--blurry-vision">&ldquo;Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim,&rdquo; &gt; Blurry vision<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dreams-visions-get-blurry-of-the-elohim--blurry-vision">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By saying “visions get blurry” Ghostface seems to be indicating that he and also Kendrick may have previously been able to see God more clearly. However, due to their impure thoughts, speech and actions, particularly in regards to “sexual impurity”, Kendrick and Ghostface’s spiritual vision and ability to see “the Elohim” / God has become blurry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of blurry vision also echos St. Paul’s First Letter to the church in Corinth in which St. Paul asserts that as humans living mortal lives in this world our spiritual vision is not clear. Rather we only see spiritual things as if we are looking at an ancient metal mirror which would have been unclear and blurry. However, St. Paul asserts that when the followers of Jesus die, are resurrected, pass through judgement and fully enter into eternal life, they will see clearly as if looking face to face.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that this teaching about seeing unclearly in this mortal life and clearly in the eternal life to come occurs within a larger passage in which St. Paul highlights God-inspired love as the greatest virtue in this mortal life and the eternal life to come  while also defining what God-inspired love looks like in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, <strong>but don’t have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal</strong>. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, <strong>but don’t have love, I am nothing</strong>. If I give away all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but <strong>don’t have love, it profits me nothing</strong>.<br>
  <br>
<strong>Love is patient and is kind. Love does not envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails.</strong><br>
  <br>
But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things. <strong>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face</strong>. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.<br>
  <br>
But now <strong>faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love</strong>.</em><br>
  <br>
-1 Corinthians 13:1-13</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As has been noted elsewhere, love is one of the central themes specifically within the chorus and verses of “Purple Hearts”:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I know <strong>y&rsquo;all love it when the drugs talkin&rsquo;</strong>, but<br>
<strong>Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin&rsquo;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>How&rsquo;s love when it&rsquo;s haunting your soul?</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Now, if it&rsquo;s love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes</strong>, sometimes<br>
And if I feel where your heart can be, you&rsquo;ll still be a part of me<br>
<strong>I love my</strong>, love my (Love my, love my)<br>
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform<br>
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)<br>
<strong>I just might love you still, just think I love me more</strong><br>
<strong>It ain&rsquo;t love if you gon&rsquo; judge me for my past<br>
No, it ain&rsquo;t love if you ain&rsquo;t never eat my ass</strong><br>
It ain&rsquo;t love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag</em></li>

<p>Throughout the Bible, the biblical authors use light as a motif that is closely associated with “the Elohim” / God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first creation narrative in Genesis 1, the pre-created world is described as being in darkness until “the Elohim” / God commands light to appear as the first act of creation.</p>

And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and <strong>darkness was over the surface of the deep water</strong>, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.Then <strong>God, the Elohim, said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. God, the Elohim, saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.”</strong></em><br>
-Genesis 1:1-5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, in the introduction to St. John’s account of the Gospel, St. John describes Jesus as the “light of humanity” and who “enlightens every human.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>In the beginning</strong> was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <strong>He was in the beginning with God</strong>. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and <strong>the life was the Light of humanity. And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it. This was the true Light that, coming into the world, enlightens every human</strong>.</em><br>
-John 1:1-5,9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus taught that he is the “Light of the world.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus again spoke to the Judeans, saying, “<strong>I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life</strong>.”</em>
-John 8:12</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In St. John’s First Letter to the whole Church, St. John summarizes the entire message of the Gospel / Good News by saying that God, the Elohim, is light.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, towards the end of his life, St. John had a vision (aka revelation) in which he saw Jesus as the Son of God who would one day bring justice to the patterns of evil in the world once and for all and create a new heaven and a new earth. In St. John’s vision of the new heaven and new earth he sees a new city of Jerusalem coming down from heaven to earth. Moreover, St. John notes that in the new heaven and new earth there will no longer be any night and humans will no longer need the light of lamps or even the light of the sun because Yahweh, the Elohim, (aka the Lord God) will shine light on all humans who have passed through judgement into eternal life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>There will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illuminate them; and they will reign forever and ever</strong>.</em><br>
-Revelation 22:5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on “Rich Spirit” Kendrick mentions the concept of the “New Earth” in connection to Ekhart Tolle’s book “A New Earth”, which takes its title from St. John’s vision in the book of Revelation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The New Earth</strong> in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives</em></li>

<ul>
<li>A retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of an eye that senses light and sends images to the brain.<br>
 </li>
<li>If a retina tears it could lead to vision loss and even blindness. Such tears are most likely to be caused by a mechanical force inside the eye. However, the intense and focused light of a high powered laser can tear retinas.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, while the light of ”the Elohim” / God represents the ultimate good which drives away the darkness, as the most intense and focused light that has existed before creation, the light of “the Elohim” / God can also “tear retinas in a single gleam” and blind humans so that they are no longer able to see any light.</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">St. Paul blinded by the light</summary>
    
      <h4 id="its-light-its-known-to-tear-retinas-in-a-single-gleam--st-paul-blinded-by-the-light">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s light, it&rsquo;s known to tear retinas in a single gleam&rdquo; &gt; St. Paul blinded by the light<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-light-its-known-to-tear-retinas-in-a-single-gleam--st-paul-blinded-by-the-light">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The most famous example of a person being blinded by the light of God / the Elohim occurs in the story of St. Paul’s transformation from being a killer of Christians to being one of the most famous and influential Christians in history as he was largely responsible for spreading Christianity across the Roman Empire.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to becoming a Christian, St. Paul-who was also known as Saul-was an upstanding member of the Pharisee religious group and was extremely zealous in his commitment to practicing Judaism as it had been practiced by his ancestors.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St. Paul never met Jesus during Jesus’s earthly life. However, after Jesus’s death, resurrection and ascension up into the heavens, Paul (who at the time primarily known by his Hebrew name, Saul) was living in Jerusalem when the first church in Jerusalem was rapidly expanding with people who were practicing traditional Judaism but were now also recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, or Christ, the anointed king about whom the Old Testament prophets had prophesied.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saul along with the other members of the Pharisee religious group were convinced that the beliefs and practices of Judaism were incompatible with Jesus being recognized as the Messianic, anointed king. Moreover, since Saul and the other Pharisees did not believe that Jesus was God, they were convinced that worshipping Jesus as the Lord and the Son of God was a form of idolatry that deserved to be punished by death under the laws of Judaism that were given to Moses in the Old Testament.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saul’s zealous commitment to Judaism as it had been practiced by his ancestors drove him to take on the responsibility of finding any Judeans who were now followers of Jesus, arrest them and bring them to the Judeans’ religious court where they could be imprisoned, tried, condemned and sentenced to death. Saul even got permission to go to the city of Damascus in modern-day Syria in order to hunt down followers of Jesus who had fled from the persecution in Jerusalem.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Saul was traveling on the road to Damascus he saw a light from the heavens which knocked him to the ground and blinded him. He also heard a voice from the heavens which said “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” Saul responded to the voice by asking “Who are You, Lord?” The voice replied by saying, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voice also told Paul to go into the city of Damascus and wait for further instructions. However, Saul was now blind and had to be led into the city by his traveling companion.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few days the Lord appeared in a vision to a follower of Jesus who was living in Damascus. The Lord instructed this follower to go to the house where Paul was staying so that Saul could be healed, receive back his sight and become a messenger who would bring the Good News of Jesus’s life, death and resurrection to people of numerous nations around the Mediterranean.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Saul received back his sight, he was baptized and soon began announcing that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God. As followers of the Pharisee religious group rejected Saul and tried to kill him on numerous occasions, Saul began to announce the Good News to Greek speaking people throughout the Roman Empire and became primarily known by his Greek name, Paul.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Saul/Paul’s to being blinded by the light of God was a perfect example of someone who seemed to be a very noble person but was actually a killer as Kendrick discussed in “Worldwide Steppers.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a killer, he&rsquo;s a killer, she&rsquo;s a killer</strong>, bitch<br>
<strong>We some killers</strong>, walkin&rsquo; zombies, tryna scratch that itch<br>
…<br>
The <strong>noble person that goes to work and pray</strong> like they &lsquo;posed to?<br>
<strong>Slaughter people too</strong>, your murder&rsquo;s just a bit slower</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, within the context of “Purple Hearts”, St. Paul is a perfect example of someone who was speaking hateful and murderous threats against God’s people until God shut him up and forced him to listen to the voice of Jesus, the Son of God—a voice which came down from the heavens and taught St. Paul how to truly love others.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Love</summary>
    
      <h4 id="shut-the-fuck-up-when-you-hear-his-love-talkin--love">&ldquo;Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin&rsquo;&rdquo; &gt; Love<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#shut-the-fuck-up-when-you-hear-his-love-talkin--love">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here Ghostface echoes the line from hook where Kendrick says “Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin&rsquo;”. However, instead of saying “hear love talkin’”, Ghostface says “hear His love talkin’”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of this Ghostface’s verse, the pronoun “His” is almost surely a reference to the Most High God, “the Elohim”, who was revealed in visible form by Jesus the anointed king (aka Messiah or Christ) whose feet were anointed by a crying prostitute.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we discussed in the line “It’s light—It&rsquo;s known to tear retinas in a single gleam”, the idea of someone being told to shut up and listen to God’s love mirrors the story of St. Paul who heard the voice of Jesus speaking from the heavens to turn St. Paul from hatred to love.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the chorus version of this line, the phrase “hear love talkin’” Kendrick seems to be telling us to listen to a personified embodiment of love. Hence, when Ghostface alters the phrase to say “hear His love talking” it seems to imply that God’s love can almost be thought of as a personified embodiment of perfect love.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notably, this idea that God being the personified embodiment of perfect love is the same conclusion that St. John makes during his first letter to the entire Church where he teaches that Jesus’s followers should listen to God’s commandment to love each other because “God is love”. Moreover, St. John teaches that God’s love is fully expressed by Jesus, the Son of God, bringing reconciliation between God and sinful humans. Because of this reconciliation, humans who love each other have hope that after they die, they will pass through God’s judgement and into eternal life.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Beloved, <strong>let’s love one another; for love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love</strong>. By this <strong>the love of God was revealed</strong> in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that <strong>He loved us and sent His Son to be the reconciliation for our sins</strong>.<br>
 <br>
Beloved, <strong>if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us</strong>. By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us, because <strong>He has given to us of His Spirit</strong>. We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.<br>
 <br>
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. <strong>God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him</strong>. By this, <strong>love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment</strong>, because we also are in this world just as He is.</em><br>
 <br>
-1 John 4:7-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ghostface seems to have referenced this passage from St. John’s first letter to the Church during an <a href="https://youtu.be/hZ6Ha0p9ZUM?si=I-39KRRZeoQaUP0w&amp;t=934">interview with MONTREALITY</a>.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>It&rsquo;s a war between God and Devil</strong>, man. And the devil is just doing his job so you can&rsquo;t even get mad at the Devil because that&rsquo;s what he came to do. But you don&rsquo;t got to be a follower. If you had a choice to choose what gang you going to go to, I&rsquo;m going go to the God gang because love always overcomes hate any day and <strong>God is love and the Devil is hate</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This passage from St. John’s letter to the Church, echoes Jesus’s own teaching that the greatest of God&rsquo;s commandments is to love God and at the same time to love other humans (i.e. one’s neighbor).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus gave this teaching after one of the experts in the biblical commandments given to Moses in the first section of the Old Testament asked Jesus what the greatest commandment is. Jesus responded by giving two commandments: “Love Yahweh, the Lord, your Elohim” and “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>An <strong>expert in the law of Moses asked Jesus</strong> a question to test Jesus: “Teacher, <strong>which is the great commandment in the Law?</strong>”<br>
 <br>
<strong>Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets</strong>.”</em><br>
 <br>
-Matthew 22:35-40</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus implies that these two commandments are simultaneously the greatest commandment because they both command humans to love. Jesus even says that the central message of the entire Old Testament (including the first section called the Torah/Law and the second section called the Prophets) can be summarized with these two commandments to love.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in the album on the track “Auntie Diaries” Kendrick references Jesus’s commandment to “love your neighbor as yourself” when he stands up to criticize a Church pastor who focused on enforcing that someone should follow some of God’s important but lesser commandments while not showing much of a concern for whether he was personally following the greatest commandment.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Demetrius is Mary-Ann now<br>
<strong>Remember church, Easter Sunday?</strong><br>
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith<br>
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight<br>
Which I found ironic &lsquo;cause <strong>the pastor didn&rsquo;t see him the same</strong><br>
He said my cousin was going through some things<br>
<strong>He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination<br>
And Demetrius was to blame</strong><br>
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman<br>
Wondering if God still call you a decent man<br>
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint<br>
Until <strong>he singled you out to prove his point</strong>, saying<br>
&ldquo;Demetrius is Mary-Ann now<br>
Church, his auntie is a man now,&rdquo; it hurt<br>
You the most &lsquo;cause your belief was close to his words<br>
<strong>Forcing me to stand now<br>
I said, &ldquo;Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?”</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, on the track “Savior” Kendrick admitted that he struggled to follow Jesus’s commandment to love his neighbors and thus could not be a savior like Jesus.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>The cat is out the bag, <strong>I am not your savior<br>
I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors</strong><br>
Especially when people got ambiguous favors<br>
But they hearts not in it, see, everything&rsquo;s for the paper</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>With this line, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is such a transcendent experience that the human mind cannot experience it in its entirety. However, the human mind can receive a “small portion” of what it experiences as “God’s cypher divine.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word “cipher” (alternatively spelled “cipher”) has a few distinct meanings including:</p>
<ol>
<li>A way to communicate secrets through encoded messages</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>The number zero</li>
<li>A gathering of freestyling rappers</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ghostface seems to be all these meanings simultaneously.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, within the context of information security and cryptography, a “cypher” is a method of transforming or encoding a message to keep it secret. A cryptography cypher will often have set rules on how to change the unencrypted letters of the input text to be different letters, numbers, words or symbols in the encrypted output text. If someone knows the rules of the cypher, they may be able to “de-cypher” the output text in order to determine the input text.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the surface, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is like hearing an encoded message that one has to decipher to fully understand.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On another level, Ghostface also seems to be giving us an de-cyphered message with the words “God’s cypher divine”. Each of these words have special significance within the spiritual offshoot of the Nation of Islam which is known as the Five Percent Nation, and with whom Ghostface Killah and other members of Wu-Tang Clan have been associated through numerous lyrics that reference teachings and concepts from Five Percent Nation.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way that the Five Percent Nation communicates its teaching is through a cypher called <a href="https://genius.com/Nation-of-gods-and-earths-supreme-mathematics-annotated">Supreme Mathematics</a> in which each digit from 0 to 9 each map to a word and another cypher called the <a href="https://genius.com/Nation-of-gods-and-earths-supreme-alphabet-annotated">Supreme Alphabet</a> in which each letter from A to Z maps to a particular word.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, “A” maps to the word “Allah” (the Arabic word for God). “B” maps to the word “be” or the word “born”. “C” maps to the word “see”. “D” maps to the word “divine”. “E” maps to the word “equality”. “F” maps to the word “father” and “G” maps to the word “God.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, “O” maps to the word “cypher” comes from an Arabic word which means “zero” and the numeral 0 is a round, circular shape just like the letter “O”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the phrase “God’s cypher divine” maps to the letters “G-O-D”, which spells God. Hence, within the Supreme Alphabet, God can be envisioned as the one who conducts a divine cypher.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the word “cypher” can also refer to a gathering of freestyling rappers. The use of the word “cypher” to describe such a gathering is likely derived from the fact that from the earliest years of hip hop, freestyling rappers would typically stand in a circle and take turns rapping, often using encoded language and references.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by saying “To the mind, it’s God’s cypher divine”, Ghostface seems to be saying that “hearing God’s love talking” is equivalent to listening to God rapping a verse or conveying encoded messages through the verses of the rappers that God has chosen to be in his inner circle.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick has depicted himself as a prophet of God, beginning as early as “Moral Man” on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> and continuing throughout <em>DAMN.</em>, particularly on the track “DNA.” and “family ties.”<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you&rsquo;re very welcome<br>
You tell me my song is more than a song, it&rsquo;s surely a blessing<br>
But <strong>a prophet ain&rsquo;t a prophet &rsquo;til they ask you this question</strong>:<br>

-”Mortal Man”<br>
 </li>
<li><em>And Nazareth gonna plead his case<br>

-”DNA.”<br>
 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m not a trending topic, <strong>I&rsquo;m a prophet</strong><br>
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel</em><br>
-”family ties”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Kendrick did ask God to speak through him on “Worldwide Steppers”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Writer&rsquo;s block for two years, nothin&rsquo; moved me<br>
<strong>Asked God to speak through me, that&rsquo;s what you hearin&rsquo; now<br>
The voice of yours truly</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, throughout Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Kendrick also expresses the idea that he has lost his way and is somehow distant from God.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I wonder where I lost my way?</strong><br>
Been waiting on your call all day</em><br>
-”Die Hard”<br>
 </li>
<li><em><strong>Askin&rsquo; God, &ldquo;Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?</strong>&rdquo;<br>
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, &ldquo;Is there an addiction?&rdquo;<br>
I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but this time I lied, <strong>I knew that I can&rsquo;t fix it</strong></em><br>
-”Mother I Sober”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, within the overall context of Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, it seems like Ghostface Killah is the rapper who has been chosen to spit a verse as a part of “God’s cypher divine” while Kendrick really needs to “shut the fuck up” and listen to “God’s love talking’” through Ghostface.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Earlier in the verse, Ghostface rapped, “visions get blurry of the Elohim”. Here the blurry, unclear perception of “the Elohim” / God seems to also lead to unclear perceptions of the world due to “faded pictures.” This lack of clarity in the world leads to a state of chaos and “global madness.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of the word “madness” seems to indicate some state of psychological distress or other mental health issue. Moreover, within the context of Kendrick’s catalog, the word madness is a clear reference to Kendrick album <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> in which Kendrick depicts the city of Compton as a place that is afflicted with madness due to the effects of relational conflict, violence, drug addiction, generational trauma and other debilitating issues. These depictions of “madness” are most notable in the tracks “good kid”, “m.A.A.d city” and “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.”<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>All I see in this room: 20&rsquo;s, Xannies and these &lsquo;shrooms<br>

It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans<br>
It got ugly, wavin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; hand out the window — check yourself<br>
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance<br>
With society, the driver seat, the <strong>first one to get killed<br>
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out</strong><br>
At the same burger stand where **** hang out<br>
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin&rsquo; that he did it<br>
But ever since that day, I was lookin&rsquo; at him different<br>
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine<br>
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime<br>
Pack a van with four guns at a time<br>
With the sliding door, fuck is up?<br>
Fuck you shootin&rsquo; for if you ain&rsquo;t walkin&rsquo; up, you fuckin&rsquo; punk?<br>
Pickin&rsquo; up the fuckin&rsquo; pump, pickin&rsquo; off you suckers<br>
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch<br>
<strong>A wall of bullets comin&rsquo; from AK&rsquo;s, AR&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Ayy, y&rsquo;all, duck&rdquo;<br>
That&rsquo;s what mama said when we was eatin&rsquo; that free lunch</strong><br>
Aw man, goddamn, <strong>all hell broke loose<br>
You killed my cousin back in &lsquo;94, fuck yo&rsquo; truce</strong><br>
Now <strong>crawl your head in that noose<br>
You wind up dead on the news<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no peace treaty</strong>, just piecin&rsquo; BGs up to pre-approve<br>
<strong>Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs<br>
Obviously the coroner between the sheets</strong> like the Isleys<br>
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color&rsquo;s correct<br>
Make sure you&rsquo;re corporate, or they&rsquo;ll be callin&rsquo; your mother collect<br>
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except<br>
When <strong>we in traffic and tragic happens</strong>, that shit ain&rsquo;t no threat<br>
You movin&rsquo; backwards if you suggest that you <strong>sleep with a TEC</strong><br>
<strong>Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess<br>

<ul>
<li>In the context of relational issues, destructive behavior or addiction, the word “intervention” is used to describe a deliberate and often structured attempt to address problematic behavior. Most often an “intervention” is initiated by close family members or friends who are very aware of the problematic behavior even as the person with the problematic behavior remains unaware of or resistant to the consequences of their actions. In many cases, those close family members or friends may first consult with a trained mental or behavioral health professional and may recommend specific actions for the person such as starting some form of therapy or entering into a rehabilitation (aka rehab) program.<br>
 </li>
<li>Throughout, Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Kendrick’s partner, Whitney, seems to be the person who is trying to initiate an intervention in response to Kendrick’s sex addiction even as Kendrick repeatedly denies that he has a problem and initially resists starting therapy or taking any steps to change his behavior.<br>
 
<ul>
<li><em>I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime<br>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Divine intervention</summary>
    
      <h4 id="faded-pictures-this-global-madness-need-intervention--divine-intervention">&ldquo;Faded pictures, this global madness need intervention&rdquo; &gt; Divine intervention<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#faded-pictures-this-global-madness-need-intervention--divine-intervention">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By saying “this global madness need intervention”, Ghostface seems to be suggesting that the entire globe as a whole is in a state of psychological distress or “madness” while continuing to remain unaware or in denial of the consequences of its problematic behavior. With the entire world being such a large and all encompassing entity which continues to deny its “madness” and problematic behavior, it would seem that God, the Elohim, is the only one who could initiate a “divine intervention” likely by means of “God’s cypher divine”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, the story of the Gospel as told by St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St. John is a story about God initiating a divine intervention because of God’s love for ”the world”. This idea is clearly stated by Jesus’s own words in St. John’s account of the Gospel</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son</strong>, so that <strong>everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life</strong>. For God <strong>did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him</strong></em><br>
-John 3:16-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also worth noting that in 2010 Lecrea, the most famous and influential rapper within the Chritian hip hop subgenre released an album called <em>Rehab</em> which included a track called “Divine Intervention”.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>‘Cause I’ve been missing all the notes<br>
In the minor keys and the major ones<br>
And the key to life is coming to the end of it<br>
And embracing Christ<br>
…<br>
We all hanging by a thread cutting at the wires<br>
Ignorant that all the sin lead to hellfire<br>
And when I yell fire, they tell me false alarm<br>
‘Cause they don’t smell the smoke and they don’t sense the harm<br>
Something worse than the black plague’s coming<br>
And nothing under the sun can save us from it<br>
There’s no hope but divine intervention<br>
And Christ saves victims who are dying from addiction<br>
…<br>
<strong>‘Cause we all dying and we all trying<br>
To stay alive</strong> but the truth we ain’t all buying<br>
Those of us who buy it, We’re never bought from<br>
We gon’ live free forever in the Savior’s arms<br>
<strong>It’s all needles in arms full of life’s drugs<br>
Lust, pride, hate, death running through our blood<br>
Need a blood donor, need a transfusion<br>
He’s over hanging on the cross for your substitution</strong><br>
So in conclusion, <strong>only one solution<br>
Trust divine intervention as your resolution</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, within tracklisting of <em>Rehab</em>, “Divine Intervention” comes immediately after a track called “Killa”, which expresses the idea that unchecked lust and sexual impurity will kill a person’s relationships with God and other humans.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Uhh! I know it&rsquo;s gon&rsquo; kill me but I just can&rsquo;t let it go<br>
And the, taste so appealing it&rsquo;s got a grip upon my soul</strong><br>
These, honey dip lies mesmerize me<br>
<strong>Pride&rsquo;s got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me</strong><br>
Fools walk the path I&rsquo;m on, never to be seen again<br>
<strong>Sippin on seduction while we eatin on some secret sin</strong><br>
(No one will never know) says the whisper in my ear<br>
And I know I should be over this but <strong>I ain&rsquo;t seein clear</strong><br>
And <strong>I ain&rsquo;t leavin here, unless somebody save me<br>
Walkin to my grave, lettin evilness enslave me<br>
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies<br>
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind<br>
Her fabrical fabrication is fuelin my fascination<br>
While I&rsquo;m intoxicated she starts her assassination<br>
I&rsquo;m losin all my honor and my years to the merciless<br>

…<br>
<strong>Baby this is innocent (killa)<br>
It won&rsquo;t even hurt a little bit (killa)<br>
I&rsquo;m only here for your benefit (killa)<br>
I&rsquo;m your every wish (killa)<br>
Come on and let me in (killa)<br>
Baby this is innocent (killa)<br>
And it won&rsquo;t even hurt a little bit (killa)<br>
Close your eyes and let&rsquo;s get lost tonight (killa)<br>
It&rsquo;ll be alright (killa)<br>
You&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m not a (killa)</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Her feet go down to DEATH</strong>, so don&rsquo;t let her consume you<br>
Even though her heart is black, her exterior&rsquo;s beautiful<br>
<strong>She&rsquo;ll take yo&rsquo; life away, and strip away yo&rsquo; joy<br>
Pretends that she gon build you up but she just gon&rsquo; destroy you<br>
My friends fell low, when they was so high</strong><br>
Got me runnin scared of myself, no lie<br>
And <strong>I know I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; die, I tried cold turkey<br>
But when I&rsquo;m feelin worthy, Satan&rsquo;s sure tryin to merk me<br>
I&rsquo;m doin myself dirty, flirtin with what&rsquo;s perverted<br>
I should follow the word but I guess I&rsquo;d rather be murdered<br>
{<em>ahem</em>} Excuse me I mean martyred, cause I&rsquo;m killin myself<br>
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon&rsquo; name her Death<br>
Breath {<em>gasps</em>} taker, she take my breath away<br>
Replaces it with poison, and I&rsquo;m so swept away<br>
I need some prayer today, hope I wake up before they start my wake up<br>
Somebody make me break up, I&rsquo;m datin a (killa)</strong></em><br>
-”Killa”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick is clearly aware of Lecrae’s music and message. Back in May of 2012 a few months before the release of <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> Kendrick publicly endorsed (aka co-signed) Lecrae while making a brief cameo in Lecrae’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWvx0wdySk&amp;t=6s">music video</a> for “Church Clothes”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in 2024, Kendrick’s respect for Lecrea’s faith and commitment to the way of Jesus would become explicitly clear on the track “Watch the Party Die”. On that track Kendrick openly wondering what Lecrae would do if he was in Kendrick’s position while coming into conflict with “lame niggas” and the demonic forces that control the entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do<br>
Fuck these niggas up or show &rsquo;em just what prayer do?</strong><br>
I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1<br>
But I will—<br>
It&rsquo;s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword<br>
…<br>
<strong>A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Twilight Zone is a classic anthology TV series in which each episode tells a different science fiction, fantasy, or horror story—usually with a moral twist or psychological suspense. The Twilight Zone series is known for their eerie storytelling, surprise endings, and philosophical themes about human nature, technology, war, and society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the first season of The Twilight Zone, each episode began with a video montage and a voiceover which explains that The Twilight Zone is another name  for “the fifth dimension.” This “fifth dimension” is referred to the “dimension of imagination” which exists in the “middle ground” in between light and shadows and between all other opposing realities that we typically experience in our normal state of being in this world.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>There is a fifth dimension</strong>, beyond that which is known to man.<br>
It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.<br>
<strong>It is the middle ground between light and shadow,<br>
between science and superstition</strong>,<br>
and it lies <strong>between the pit of man&rsquo;s fears<br>
and the summit of his knowledge</strong>.<br>
This is the <strong>dimension of imagination</strong>.<br>
It is an area which we call<br>
<strong>The Twilight Zone</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The psychological, philosophical and moral aspects of The Twilight Zone stories are very similar in scope to stories that Kendrick is telling throughout Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying that “this world’s in The Twilight Zone”, Ghostface seems to be suggesting that the “global madness” that has recently become more apparent, particular in the wake of Covid-19 and the global pandemic, is really an indication that the sane and peaceful existence that most of us are used to in America and the rest of the modern West is really a facade. The true reality of the world is far more strange, dangerous, and unsettling than most of us are willing or able to comprehend.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “this is the fifth dimension” Ghostface also seems to be emphasizing the idea that this world exists in the unsettled space in between the light of God and the satanic shadows of sin. Hence as we live our lives in this world we are faced with moral choices to either move towards the light of God or towards the satanic shadows of sin.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time within the context of Ghostface’s verse we should note that the word “intervention” is derived from the Latin word “interveniō” which means “to come between.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, God the Father has initiated a divine intervention by sending Jesus, the Son of God, into the world, into the in-between space of the fifth dimension in order to shine God’s light upon every human and give them an opportunity to walk in the light of life.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Here Ghostface seems to depict God as a referee who blows a whistle to stop or pause a sports game, particularly just before break or intermission between two segments of a sports game, such as the first and second half of a football game.<br>
 </li>
<li>Within this metaphor of God being a referee, the game can be seen as a metaphor for the entirety of human existence within this world.<br>
 </li>
<li>This idea of God blowing a whistle to signal an intermission between two halves of a game also continues the motif of God initiating an intervention and sending Jesus as the Son of God into the “in-between” space of the fifth dimension.<br>
 </li>
<li>By saying “we need an intermission”, Ghostface seems playing the role of a metaphorical commentator who sees that the game has become chaotic and out of control or a metaphorical coach who sees that his team has lost all momentum and composure and needs an intermission to calm down, refocus, listen to the coach’s instruction and make several strategic adjustments.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is also notable that years after the release of Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, Kendrick would go on to perform as the headline musical act during the halftime intermission of the 2025 National Football League Superbowl game. Moreover, Kendrick’s entire performance was built around the concept of Kendrick’s life being a game.<br>
 </li>
<li>This concept of Kendrick’s life being a game was established in the promotional advertising spots which encouraged audiences to “Catch Kendrick Lamar at the top of his game in the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show.”<br>
 </li>
<li>The Halftime Show performance opened with Samuel L. Jackson dressed as “Uncle Sam” while saying &ldquo;Salutations, it&rsquo;s your Uncle Sam, and this is the great American game.”<br>
 </li>
<li>The performance took place on the football field with Kendirck going between four stages that were in the square, x, triangle and circle buttons from a PlayStation controller. The performance also ended with a shot of lights in the stands which spelled out the words “GAME OVER” in reference to a video game where the player has lost all of their lives.<br>
 </li>
<li>I previously discussed the layers of meaning of Kendrick “playing the game” during an <a href="https://faith.yale.edu/media/kendrick-lamars-political-theology">interview with the Yale Center for Faith &amp; Culture</a>.<br>
 </li>

<ul>
<li>In is also notable that Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers is divided into two discs, each with nine tracks. The first disc is called Big Steppers and the second disc is titled Mr. Morale. As track 9 of Disc 1, the end of “Purple Hearts” marks the intermission between the two halves of the album.<br>
 </li>
<li>This album intermission is particularly noticeable if you listen to the album on vinyl. On vinyl, the album is laid out on two separate vinyl records, which means that if we want to listen to the entire album we will “need an intermission” to allow someone to take the first record off The record player and put the second record on the record player.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the previous line in which Ghostface seems to recall past moments when he a gun to someone’s head and threatened to kill his enemies, Ghostface now makes a hard switch to the present where he is actively killing greed and homelessness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of killing personal and societal vices also stands in contrast to “Worldwide Steppers” where Kendrick highlights how he and other humans have killed personal and society virtues such as confidence, consciousness, accomplishments and freedom of speech.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Objectified so many bitches, <strong>I killed their confidence</strong><br>
The media&rsquo;s the new religion, <strong>you killed the consciousness</strong><br>
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, <strong>you killed accomplishments</strong><br>
<strong>Niggas killed freedom of speech</strong>, everyone sensitive<br>
If your opinion fuck &lsquo;round and leak, might as well send your will</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sudden transformation from killing enemies in the previous line to killing vices in this line also seems to be explained by the word “love” which comes “in between” these opposing inclinations. Love coming “in between” these opposing inclinations to kill enemies or kill vices also reminds of God sending Jesus as the Son of God to come into this world, which is the in-between space of the fifth dimension.<br>
 </p>

<p>Since, St. John and Ghostface have both testified to the idea that “God is love” we can also hear the word “love” as a direct address which could alternatively be heard as a prayer spoken to God (i.e. “God, we killin’ greed, we killin’ homelessness”).</p>

<ul>
<li>Within the context of Christianity and other spiritual traditions, individuals will bow their heads in order to humble themselves and show respect for God’s greatness, particularly someone who is going to pray.<br>
 </li>
<li>Ghostface seems to be addressing this imperative statement directly to Kendrick, Whitney and the entire audience. Ghostface thus seems to be playing the role of a pastor or priest who seeks to reconnect his people with God through prayer.</li>
