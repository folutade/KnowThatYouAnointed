Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview which was released by Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these abusive practices.\nYears before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offences and been given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since at the time Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assaut but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the interview (15:40 - 16:32) Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.\nI came in this business saying I was going to expose. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. It’s God’s side and the other side and we don’t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024. It’s up for all of them. It don’t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is. TD Jakes - any of them the every…All lies will be exposed. That’s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. The truth is the light.\n…\nAll people that love the truth got to be happy if the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That’s just what time it is - 2024, folks.\nIn the interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00), Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy’s parties and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities he consistently refused to attend the parties because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties.\n*My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis. That was my only goal.\n…\nI’ve had to turn down $50 million four times - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, “No.” You’ve got to tell him, “No.” I did.\nHence by saying “I think it’s time to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with - or maybe fulfilling - Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them”.\nAgain, the idea that it is almost “time” for the criminal offences of Drake and his crew will soon be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on “meet the grahams” when he predicted a police raid on Drake’s mansion, which is nicknamed “The Embassy”.\nKatt Williams said, “Get you the truth,” so I’ma get mines\nThe Embassy ‘bout to get raided too, it’s only a matter of time A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would go on to release the album GNX featuring the opening track “wacced out murals” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that truth is about to be exposed.\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\nMake Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ‘bout to get loud It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized allegations.\nFor instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14 year old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31 year old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently including Drake sending a message that said “I miss you so much” to which she replied “I miss you more”. She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.\nA year later, in 2019, roughly 5 years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes ’em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next 5 years.\n“Dude R. Kelly got away”\n“That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake’s gonna be …he’s on that R. Kelly tip.”\n“You think so?”\n“Drizzy Drake likes ’em young. He does. It’s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, ‘I don’t know.’ Drake, Drizzy Drake is into the young ones. He’s going to get got in the next 5 years, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.”\nKendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us”. In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.\nSay, Drake, I hear you like ’em young\nYou better not ever go to cell block one\nTo any bitch that talk to him and they in love\nJust make sure you hide your lil’ sister from him\nThey tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs\nAnd Party at the party playin’ with his nose now\nAnd Baka got a weird case, why is he around?\nCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck ’em up\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I’ma do my stuff\nWhy you trollin’ like a bitch? Ain’t you tired?\nTryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor Perverting God’s plan I think it’s time to watch the party die \u003e Perverting God’s plan The pedophelia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\n…\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a fan\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nThe association with simultaneous oral sex is due to the fact that the number 6 looks like a number 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees\nAside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament the “devil” (meaning “diabolical one”, “false accuser” or “liar” ) - also known as the “satan” (meaning “adversary”) - is often depicted as a figure who unlike God cannot actually create anything. Instead the “devil” / “satan” will take things that have been created by the one true God and uses lies to twist or turn them upside down.\nIn his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the “devil” / “satan” cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.\nThese people are not powerful. Satan can’t create anything that includes blessings for his people. That’s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn’t happen. They all do the same job.\nIn English the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the “devil” / “satan” or someone who behaves like the “devil” / “satan” uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing towards an evil purpose. The word “pervert” is derived from the Latin word “perverto” which means “to turn thoroughly”. Someone who habitually “perverts” good things can themselves be refered to with the noun “pervert”. Notably, Kendrick refered to Drake as a “pervert” on “meet the graham”.\nI’m lookin’ to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake - the self-proclaimed “6 god” - has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan”, in reference to Drake’s hit single.\nUltimately, the goal of the “devil” / “satan” is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God”. This pattern of lying is first depicted when the “devil” / “satan” takes on the form of snake which deceives the prototypical man and woman to eat the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.\nNow the snake was more shrewd than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”\nThe woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’”\nThe snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.\nIn the case of Kendrick’s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to reprsent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.\nSex god I think it’s time to watch the party die \u003e Sex god Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to a sexual acts, Kendrick seems to depicting Drake as a “sex god”. In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus and Liber were worshiped throughout the world including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East where most of the events of the Bible take place.\nIn many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.\nIn the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.\nHence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution. Drake denies the allegations I think it’s time to watch the party die \u003e Drake denies the allegations After the release of “meet the grahams” and “Not Like Us”, Drake released “The Heart Part 6” where Drake publicly denied the pedophelia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick’s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick’s track “mother i sober” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.\nSpeakin’ of anything with a child, let’s get to that now\nThis Epstein angle was the shit I expected\nTikTok videos you collected and dissected\nInstead of bein’ on some diss-direct shit\nYou rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit\nMy mom came over today, and I was like, “Mother, I—\nMother, I—, mother—,” ahh, wait a second\nThat’s that one record where you say you got molested\nAw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection\nThis about to get so depressin’\nThis is trauma from your own confessions\nThis when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected\nThat’s why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it’s so excessive\nThey actin’ like it’s so aggressive, but you just never known affection\nI don’t wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin’\n“Touch My Body” by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin’\nI never been with no one underage,\nbut now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with\nJust for clarity, I feel disgusted, I’m too respected\nIf I was fucking young girls, I promise I’d have been arrested\nI’m way too famous for this shit you just suggested\nBut that’s not the lesson, clearly, there’s a deeper message\n…\nDrake is not a name that you gon’ see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It You mentionin’ A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, “Who was it?” You thought you left D flat, D major …\nOnly fuckin’ with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I’d never look twice at no teenager\n…\nIf you still bumpin’ R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior This shit done got too wicked to apologize Wickedness or weakness This shit done got too wicked to apologize \u003e Wickedness or weakness Kendrick seems to be asserting that “the party” has become become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending “the party” have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.\nKendrick’s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficing, recketeering transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry as exposed by Katt Williams.\nIt is notable that that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album DAMN.. The album’s opening track, “BLOOD.” begins with the with an ominous voice which that says:\nIs it wickedness or is it weakness?\nYou decide. Are we going to live or die?”\nThroughout DAMN. Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the “wickedness” that is routinely perpetrated by poweful, violent men in this world and the “weakness” that was exhibited by Jesus who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you, and you and me\n-“PRIDE.”\nDamn, love or lust\nDamn, all of us\n-“LOVE”\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\n-“XXX.”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me involve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin’ for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin’ if I’m livin’ through fear or livin’ through rap\nDamn\n-“FEAR.” Give that throughout DAMN. Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from way of wickeness would require him to turn towards Jesus’s way of weakess, it is ironic that throughout “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultanelous building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.\nWicked sexual behavior in the Bible “This shit done got too wicked to apologize” \u003e Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of “Watch the Party Die”, it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at “the party” are “too wicked to apologize.”\nIn a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men whar are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels form getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone and the city soon gets destroyed by a fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.\nIn a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor’s wife leads to a civil war where thousand of men are killed. We war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed feast capture teenage girls from festal celebrationand force them into marriage.\nIn a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David immediately is overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman’s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David’s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba has be pregnant he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.\nLecrae refernces this story on “Die for the Party” when he raps:\nBut when I take a look in the mirror\nThe blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters\nGod soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51 in which King Devil acknowleges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness\nThat being said, despite King David’s repentance, the son that was born from King David’s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David’s second son - who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped - exeuted a plot to murder the oldest son. King David’s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to raped all of King David’s lower status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.\nOne of the major lessons of King David’s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real world consequences for David, his family and the whole society around King David.\nKendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick’s album good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick released the track “The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)” where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.\nWith a Bible and rifle: I play the game as I “blam-blaow!”\nHoller back at me, nigga\nAnd if they said that I’m the one, why you asking me, nigga?\n‘Cause when the whole world see you as ‘Pac reincarnated\nEnough pressure to make you just open the Book of David\nAnd pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix\n‘Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it’s quite contagious\nGiven that Kendrick knows the story of King David wicked behavior and subsequent aplology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy or or any of the men who have participated in “the party” can ever truly apology or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.\nFrom a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.\n",

<ul>
<li>
<p>Given that “Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Drake, it is notable that Kendrick on the fourth verse of battle track “meet the grahams” referred to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dear Aubrey<br>
I know you probably thinkin&rsquo; I wanted to crash your party</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first line of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick&rsquo;s battle with Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra, sit down, what I&rsquo;m about to say is heavy, now listen<br>
Mm-mm, your son&rsquo;s a sick man with sick thoughts<br>
&hellip;<br>
He <strong>hates Black women, hypersexualizes &rsquo;em with kinks of a nympho fetish</strong>
Grew facial hair because he understood bein&rsquo; a beard just fit him better<br>
<strong>He got sex offenders on ho-VO</strong> that he keep on a monthly allowance<br>
A <strong>child should never be compromised</strong> and he keepin&rsquo; his child around them<br>
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin&rsquo; <strong>there&rsquo;s predators like him lurkin&rsquo;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>They be streamlinin&rsquo; victims all inside of they home</strong> and callin&rsquo; &rsquo;em tender<br>
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong><br>
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away<br>
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away<br>
They lookin&rsquo; at you too if you standin&rsquo; by him, keep the family away<br>
I&rsquo;m <strong>lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In these lyrics from “meet the grahams”, Kendrick recounts a message from Black comedian, Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth”. Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview which was released by Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these abusive practices.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Years before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offences and been given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since at the time Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assaut but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=iKsx-nqFoDQbiOnu&amp;t=940">interview (15:40 - 16:32)</a> Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I came in this business saying I was going to expose</strong>. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. <strong>It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s side and the other side</strong> and we don&rsquo;t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. <strong>All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024</strong>. It&rsquo;s up for all of them. <strong>It don&rsquo;t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is</strong>. TD Jakes - any of them the every…<strong>All lies will be exposed</strong>. That&rsquo;s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. <strong>The truth is the light</strong>.<br>
&hellip;<br>
All people that love the truth got to be happy if <strong>the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That&rsquo;s just what time it is - 2024</strong>, folks.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&amp;t=6033">interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)</a>, Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy&rsquo;s parties and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities he consistently refused to attend the parties because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>*<strong>My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis</strong>. That was my only goal.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve had to turn down $50 million four times</strong> - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause <strong>P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong> You&rsquo;ve got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I did.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence by saying “I think <strong>it’s time</strong> to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with - or maybe fulfilling - Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, the idea that it is almost &ldquo;time&rdquo; for the criminal offences of Drake and his crew will soon be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; when he predicted a police raid on Drake&rsquo;s mansion, which is nicknamed &ldquo;The Embassy&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would go on to release the album <em>GNX</em> featuring the opening track “wacced out murals” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that truth is about to be exposed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
Exterminate &rsquo;em right now<br>
<strong>Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth &lsquo;bout to get loud</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized allegations.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14 year old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31 year old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently including Drake sending a message that said “I miss you so much” to which she replied “I miss you more”. She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year later, in 2019, roughly 5 years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes &rsquo;em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Dude R. Kelly got away”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake&rsquo;s gonna be …he&rsquo;s on that R. Kelly tip.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
“You think so?”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Drizzy <strong>Drake likes &rsquo;em young</strong>. He does. It&rsquo;s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; Drake, Drizzy <strong>Drake is into the young ones</strong>. <strong>He&rsquo;s going to get got in the next 5 years</strong>, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.&rdquo;</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us”. In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Say, <strong>Drake, I hear you like &rsquo;em young</strong><br>
You better not ever go to cell block one<br>
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love<br>
Just <strong>make sure you hide your lil&rsquo; sister from him</strong><br>
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs<br>
And <strong>Party at the party playin&rsquo; with his nose</strong> now<br>
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?<br>
<strong>Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles</strong><br>
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck &rsquo;em up<br>
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I&rsquo;ma do my stuff<br>
Why you trollin&rsquo; like a bitch? Ain&rsquo;t you tired?<br>
<strong>Tryna strike a chord and it&rsquo;s probably A minor</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The pedophelia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Devil is a lie, he a 69 God</strong>, ayy<br>
&hellip;<br>
The family matter and the truth of the matter<br>
<strong>It was God&rsquo;s plan to show y&rsquo;all the liar</strong><br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a<br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association with simultaneous oral sex is due to the fact that the number 6 looks like a number 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;, &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; or &ldquo;liar&rdquo; ) - also known as the &ldquo;satan&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;adversary&rdquo;) - is often depicted as a figure who unlike God cannot actually create anything. Instead the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; will take things that have been created by the one true God and uses lies to twist or turn them upside down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>These people are not powerful. <strong>Satan can&rsquo;t create anything</strong> that includes blessings for his people. That&rsquo;s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn&rsquo;t happen. They all do the same job.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In English the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; or someone who behaves like the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing towards an evil purpose. The word &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; is derived from the Latin word “perverto” which means “to turn thoroughly”. Someone who habitually &ldquo;perverts&rdquo; good things can themselves be refered to with the noun &ldquo;pervert&rdquo;. Notably, Kendrick refered to Drake as a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; on &ldquo;meet the graham&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any <strong>pervert</strong> that lives, keep the family safe</em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake - the self-proclaimed “6 god” - has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan”, in reference to Drake&rsquo;s hit single.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God”. This pattern of lying is first depicted when the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; takes on the form of snake which deceives the prototypical man and woman to eat the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now <strong>the snake was more shrewd</strong> than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he <strong>said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?</strong>”<br>
 <br>
The woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but <strong>from the fruit of the tree</strong> which is in the middle of the garden, <strong>God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die</strong>.’”<br>
 <br>
The snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and <strong>you will become like God</strong>, knowing good and evil.”<br>
 <br>
When the <strong>woman saw that the tree</strong> was good for food, and that it <strong>was a delight to the eyes</strong>, and that the tree <strong>was desirable</strong> to make one wise, <strong>she took some of its fruit and ate</strong>; and she also <strong>gave some to her husband with her, and he ate</strong>.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Kendrick&rsquo;s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to reprsent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to a sexual acts, Kendrick seems to depicting Drake as a “sex god”. In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus and Liber were worshiped throughout the world including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East where most of the events of the Bible take place.<br>
 </li>
<li>In many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and  destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After the release of &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;, Drake released “The Heart Part 6” where Drake publicly denied the pedophelia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick&rsquo;s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick&rsquo;s track &ldquo;mother i sober&rdquo; from <strong>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</strong>. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Speakin&rsquo; of anything with a child, let&rsquo;s get to that now</strong><br>
<strong>This Epstein angle was the shit I expected</strong><br>
TikTok videos you collected and dissected<br>
Instead of bein&rsquo; on some diss-direct shit<br>
You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit<br>
My mom came over today, and I was like, &ldquo;Mother, I—<br>
Mother, I—, mother—,&rdquo; ahh, wait a second<br>
That&rsquo;s that one record where you say you got molested<br>
Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection<br>
This about to get so depressin&rsquo;<br>
<strong>This is trauma from your own confessions</strong><br>
This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected<br>
That&rsquo;s why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it&rsquo;s so excessive<br>
They actin&rsquo; like it&rsquo;s so aggressive, but you just never known affection<br>
<strong>I don&rsquo;t wanna diss you anymore</strong>, this really got me second-guessin&rsquo;<br>
&ldquo;Touch My Body&rdquo; by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin&rsquo;<br>
I never been with no one underage,<br>
but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with<br>
Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I&rsquo;m too respected<br>
<strong>If I was fucking young girls, I promise I&rsquo;d have been arrested<br>
I&rsquo;m way too famous for this shit you just suggested</strong><br>
But that&rsquo;s not the lesson, clearly, there&rsquo;s a deeper message</em><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Drake is not a name that you gon&rsquo; see on no sex offender list</strong>, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin&rsquo; A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
You thought you left D flat, D major
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Only fuckin&rsquo; with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I&rsquo;d never look twice at no teenager</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>If you still bumpin&rsquo; R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior</strong></li>

      <h4 id="this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wickedness-or-weakness">This shit done got too wicked to apologize &gt; Wickedness or weakness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wickedness-or-weakness">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be asserting that &ldquo;the party&rdquo; has become become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending &ldquo;the party&rdquo; have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficing, recketeering transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry as exposed by Katt Williams.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album <em>DAMN.</em>. The album&rsquo;s opening track, &ldquo;BLOOD.&rdquo; begins with the with an ominous voice which that says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it <strong>wickedness</strong> or is it <strong>weakness</strong>?<br>
You decide. Are we going to <strong>live</strong> or <strong>die</strong>?”</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout <em>DAMN.</em> Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; that is routinely perpetrated by poweful, violent men in this world and the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; that was exhibited by Jesus who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Love&rsquo;s gonna get you killed<br>
But pride&rsquo;s gonna be the death of you, and you and me</em><br>
-&ldquo;PRIDE.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Damn, love or lust<br>
Damn, all of us</em><br>
-&ldquo;LOVE&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Hail Mary, <strong>Jesus</strong>, and Joseph<br>
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives<br>
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters<br>
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us<br>
<strong>It&rsquo;s murder</strong> on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
<strong>Homicidal thoughts</strong>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br>
But <strong>is America honest or do we bask in sin?</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;XXX.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; creativity<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of missin&rsquo; out on you and me<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; loyalty from pride<br>
&lsquo;Cause my DNA won&rsquo;t let me involve in the light of God<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that my humbleness is gone<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that love ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; here no more<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, <strong>fear that it&rsquo;s wickedness or weakness</strong><br>
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive<br>
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
And I can&rsquo;t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse<br>
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br>
Searchin&rsquo; for resolutions <strong>until somebody get back</strong><br>
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
And I can&rsquo;t take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse<br>
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br>
<strong>Wonderin&rsquo; if I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; through fear or livin&rsquo; through rap</strong><br>
Damn</em><br>
-&ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give that throughout <em>DAMN.</em> Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from way of wickeness would require him to turn towards Jesus&rsquo;s way of weakess, it is ironic that throughout &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultanelous building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible</summary>
    
      <h4 id="this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">&ldquo;This shit done got too wicked to apologize&rdquo; &gt; Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at &ldquo;the party&rdquo; are &ldquo;too wicked to apologize.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men whar are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels form getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone and the city soon gets destroyed by a fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor&rsquo;s wife leads to a civil war where thousand of men are killed. We war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed feast capture teenage girls from festal celebrationand force them into marriage.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David immediately is overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman&rsquo;s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David&rsquo;s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba has be pregnant he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae refernces this story on &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo; when he raps:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>But when I take a look in the mirror<br>
The <strong>blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer</strong><br>
Who <strong>had Bathsheba in his quarters</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>God soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51 in which King Devil acknowleges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, despite King David&rsquo;s repentance, the son that was born from King David&rsquo;s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David&rsquo;s second son - who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped - exeuted a plot to murder the oldest son. King David&rsquo;s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to raped all of King David’s lower status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the major lessons of King David&rsquo;s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real world consequences for David, his family and the whole society around King David.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick released the track &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)&rdquo; where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With a Bible and rifle</strong>: I play the game as I &ldquo;blam-blaow!&rdquo;<br>
Holler back at me, nigga<br>
And if they said that I&rsquo;m the one, why you asking me, nigga?<br>
&lsquo;Cause when the whole world see you as &lsquo;Pac reincarnated<br>
<strong>Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David<br>
And pray to God that you make it</strong> or live your life in The Matrix<br>
&lsquo;Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it&rsquo;s quite contagious<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Kendrick knows the story of King David wicked behavior and subsequent aplology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy or or any of the men who have participated in &ldquo;the party&rdquo; can ever truly apology or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.<br>
