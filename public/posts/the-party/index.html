The first and second verse begin with the words “I think it’s time to watch the party die” which would lead to it being referred to by the name “Watch the Party Die”.\nThe release of “Watch the Party Die” came four months after Kendrick released “Not Like Us”, the diss track which eventually went on to win five Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. “Not Like Us” led to Kendrick being almost unanimously declared the winner of the rap battle with Drake by relentlessly attacking Drake’s reputation and popularizing an accusation that Drake is a pedophile.\nSay, Drake, I hear you like ’em young\nYou better not ever go to cell block one\nTo any bitch that talk to him and they in love\nJust make sure you hide your lil’ sister from him\n…\nCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles\n…\nWhy you trollin’ like a bitch? Ain’t you tired?\nTryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor\n-“Not Like Us” The release of “Watch the Party Die” also came two months before the release of Kendrick’s album GNX, where Kendrick’s animosity against Drake seems to expand to anyone who aligns themselves with Drake by not giving Kendrick the respect and loyalty that Kendrick believes he deserves.\nIt used to be fuck that nigga, but now it’s plural\nFuck everybody, that’s on my body\nMy blick first, then God got me\n…\nThey like, “Dot big trippin’,” I just want what I deserve\nWhat bridge they done burnt? All of them, it’s over with\nI’m doin’ what COVID did, they’ll never get over it\n…\nOkay, nigga, let’s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal\nSince y’all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you\nOkay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die\n…\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\n-“wacced out murals” “Watch the Party Die” thus serves as a bridge between Kendrick’s battle with Drake and Kendrick’s album GNX. Thematically, “Watch the Party Die” seems to offer an important perspective on the battle and the album as the track seems to implicitly ask a deeply philosophical question: What should we as a society do to humans who perpetrate evil or enable others to perpetrate evil?\nIf we are to take the battle, “Watch the Party Die” and GNX at face value, the answer to this question would seem to be that we should “exterminate them right now”. However, on the final verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick’s deeply held Christian beliefs briefly come to the surface as he wonders what Christian hip hop artist Lecrae would want us to do to humans who perpetrate evil or enable others to perpetrate evil.\nOn September 14, three days after Kendrick’s Instagram post, Lecrae shared an Instagram post that features a tightly cropped photo of a pair of white Air Force 1 shoes and an untitled new song in which Lecrae raps a verse to a modified version of the beat from Kendrick’s post. The song—which was later released under the title “Die for the Party”—serves as Lecrae’s response to Kendrick wondering what Lecrae would do.\nThe contrast between the black Air Force 1 shoes in Kendrick’s post and the white Air Force 1 shoes in Lecrae’s post emphasizes the idea that “Watch the Party Die” and “Die For the Party” represent two opposing perspectives on how we should respond to human evil.\nWith 2024 being a year in which Kendrick won five Grammy Awards by accusing Drake of being a pedophile, Diddy was arrested and charged with sex trafficking, college campuses were shut down due to protests against Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza, the elected U.S. president was routinely compared to Hitler, and much of the internet celebrated the murder of a health insurance CEO, it seems well worth the time to go through a deep, line-by-line analysis of Kendrick Lamar’s “Watch the Party Die” and Lecrae’s “Die for the Party”, which is what this blog post aims to do.\n“Watch the Party Die” by Kendrick Lamar [Verse 1] I think it’s time to watch the party die Pedophile parties “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Pedophile parties “Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham, who is better known by his middle name, Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams,” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin’ I wanted to crash your party The first line of “Watch the Party Die” thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick’s battle with Drake.\nAmong the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.\nSandra, sit down, what I’m about to say is heavy, now listen\nMm-mm, your son’s a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualizes ’em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein’ a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin’ his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin’ there’s predators like him lurkin’\n…\nThey be streamlinin’ victims all inside of they home and callin’ ’em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas\n…\nKatt Williams said, “Get you the truth,” so I’ma get mines\nThe Embassy ‘bout to get raided too, it’s only a matter of time\nAyy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away\nTo anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away\nThey lookin’ at you too if you standin’ by him, keep the family away\nI’m lookin’ to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe In these lyrics from “meet the grahams,” Kendrick asserts that sexual predators like Drake or Harvey Weinstein should die, much like the party in “Watch the Party Die.”\nKendrick also recounts a message from Black comedian Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth.” Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview, which was released by the Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these predatory practices.\nYears before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offenses and given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since, at the time, Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assault but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the interview (15:40 - 16:32), Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.\nI came in this business saying I was going to expose. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. It’s God’s side and the other side and we don’t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024. It’s up for all of them. It don’t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is. TD Jakes - any of them the every…All lies will be exposed. That’s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. The truth is the light.\n…\nAll people that love the truth got to be happy if the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That’s just what time it is - 2024, folks.\nIn the interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00), Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy’s parties, and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities, he consistently refused to attend because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties.\nMy goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis. That was my only goal.\n…\nI’ve had to turn down $50 million four times - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, “No.” You’ve got to tell him, “No.” I did.\nHence, by saying “I think it’s time to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with—or maybe fulfilling—Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them.”\nAgain, the idea that it is almost “time” for the criminal offenses of Drake and his crew to be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on “meet the grahams” when he predicted a police raid on Drake’s mansion, which is nicknamed “The Embassy.”\nKatt Williams said, “Get you the truth,” so I’ma get mines\nThe Embassy ‘bout to get raided too, it’s only a matter of time A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick would go on to release the album GNX, featuring the opening track “wacced out murals,” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that the truth is about to be exposed.\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\nMake Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ‘bout to get loud It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized, allegations.\nFor instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14-year-old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31-year-old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently, including Drake sending a message that said, “I miss you so much,” to which she replied, “I miss you more.” She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.\nA year later, in 2019, roughly five years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes ’em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next five years.\n“Dude R. Kelly got away”\n“That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake’s gonna be …he’s on that R. Kelly tip.”\n“You think so?”\n“Drizzy Drake likes ’em young. He does. It’s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, ‘I don’t know.’ Drake, Drizzy Drake is into the young ones. He’s going to get got in the next 5 years, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.”\nKendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us.” In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party,” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.\nSay, Drake, I hear you like ’em young\nYou better not ever go to cell block one\nTo any bitch that talk to him and they in love\nJust make sure you hide your lil’ sister from him\nThey tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs\nAnd Party at the party playin’ with his nose now\nAnd Baka got a weird case, why is he around?\nCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck ’em up\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I’ma do my stuff\nWhy you trollin’ like a bitch? Ain’t you tired?\nTryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor\n…\nAnd your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks\nThat name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch Perverting God’s plan “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Perverting God’s plan The pedophilia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex, due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees.\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\n…\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a fan\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nAside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament, the “devil” (meaning “diabolical one,” “false accuser,” or “liar”)—also known as the “satan” (meaning “adversary”)—is often depicted as a figure who, unlike God, cannot actually create anything. Instead, the “devil” / “satan” will take things that have been created by the one true God and use lies to twist or turn them upside down.\nIn his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the “devil” / “satan” cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.\nThese people are not powerful. Satan can’t create anything that includes blessings for his people. That’s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn’t happen. They all do the same job.\nIn English, the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the “devil” / “satan” or someone who behaves like the “devil” / “satan” uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing toward an evil purpose. The word “pervert” is derived from the Latin word “perverto,” which means “to turn thoroughly.” Someone who habitually “perverts” good things can themselves be referred to with the noun “pervert.” Notably, Kendrick referred to Drake as a “pervert” on “meet the grahams.”\nI’m lookin’ to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake—the self-proclaimed “6 god”—has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan,” in reference to Drake’s hit single.\nUltimately, the goal of the “devil” / “satan” is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God.” This pattern of lying is first depicted when the “devil” / “satan” takes on the form of a snake, which deceives the prototypical man and woman into eating the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.\nNow the snake was more shrewd than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”\nThe woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’”\nThe snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.\nIn the case of Kendrick’s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to represent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.\nSex god “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Sex god Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to sexual acts, Kendrick seems to be depicting Drake as a “sex god.” In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus, and Liber were worshiped throughout the world, including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East, where most of the events of the Bible take place.\nIn many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.\nIn the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.\nHence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution. Drake denies the allegations “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Drake denies the allegations After the release of “meet the grahams” and “Not Like Us,” Drake released “The Heart Part 6,” where Drake publicly denied the pedophilia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick’s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick’s track “mother i sober” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.\nSpeakin’ of anything with a child, let’s get to that now\nThis Epstein angle was the shit I expected\nTikTok videos you collected and dissected\nInstead of bein’ on some diss-direct shit\nYou rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit\nMy mom came over today, and I was like, “Mother, I—\nMother, I—, mother—,” ahh, wait a second\nThat’s that one record where you say you got molested\nAw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection\nThis about to get so depressin’\nThis is trauma from your own confessions\nThis when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected\nThat’s why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it’s so excessive\nThey actin’ like it’s so aggressive, but you just never known affection\nI don’t wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin’\n“Touch My Body” by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin’\nI never been with no one underage,\nbut now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with\nJust for clarity, I feel disgusted, I’m too respected\nIf I was fucking young girls, I promise I’d have been arrested\nI’m way too famous for this shit you just suggested\nBut that’s not the lesson, clearly, there’s a deeper message\n…\nDrake is not a name that you gon’ see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It You mentionin’ A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, “Who was it?” You thought you left D flat, D major …\nOnly fuckin’ with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I’d never look twice at no teenager\n…\nIf you still bumpin’ R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior This shit done got too wicked to apologize Wickedness or weakness “This shit done got too wicked to apologize” \u003e Wickedness or weakness Kendrick seems to be asserting that “the party” has become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending “the party” have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.\nKendrick’s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties, which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry, as exposed by Katt Williams.\nIt is notable that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album DAMN.. The album’s opening track, “BLOOD.,” begins with an ominous voice that says:\nIs it wickedness or is it weakness?\nYou decide. Are we going to live or die?”\nThroughout DAMN., Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the “wickedness” that is routinely perpetrated by powerful, violent men in this world and the “weakness” that was exhibited by Jesus, who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you, and you and me\n-“PRIDE.”\nDamn, love or lust\nDamn, all of us\n-“LOVE”\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\n-“XXX.”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me involve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin’ for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin’ if I’m livin’ through fear or livin’ through rap\nDamn\n-“FEAR.” Given that throughout DAMN., Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from the way of wickedness would require him to turn towards Jesus’s way of weakness, it is ironic that throughout “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultaneously building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.\nWicked sexual behavior in the Bible “This shit done got too wicked to apologize” \u003e Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of “Watch the Party Die,” it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive, and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at “the party” are “too wicked to apologize.”\nIn a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men who are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels from getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone, and the city soon gets destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.\nIn a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor’s wife leads to a civil war where thousands of men are killed. The war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed to capture teenage girls from a festival celebration and force them into marriage.\nIn a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses, and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David is immediately overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman’s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah, who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David’s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah, and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace, where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba is pregnant, he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child, he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.\nLecrae references this story of King David’s sexual misconduct with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah on “Die for the Party” when he raps:\nBut when I take a look in the mirror\nThe blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters\nGod soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51, in which King David acknowledges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness.\nThat being said, despite King David’s repentance, the son that was born from King David’s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover, later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David’s second son—who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped—executed a plot to murder the oldest son. King David’s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to rape all of King David’s lower-status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.\nOne of the major lessons of King David’s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real-world consequences for David, his family, and the whole society around King David.\nKendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick’s album good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick released the track “The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)” where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David, and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.\nWith a Bible and rifle: I play the game as I “blam-blaow!”\nHoller back at me, nigga\nAnd if they said that I’m the one, why you asking me, nigga?\n‘Cause when the whole world see you as ‘Pac reincarnated\nEnough pressure to make you just open the Book of David\nAnd pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix\n‘Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it’s quite contagious\nGiven that Kendrick knows the story of King David’s wicked behavior and subsequent apology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy, or any of the men who have participated in “the party” can ever truly apologize or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others whom he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.\nFrom a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that would allow him to justify the use of violence to eliminate his enemies or those whom he considers to be an enemy of society, which is exactly what he does throughout the rest of “Watch the Party Die.”\nIt’s different, get him whacked and disqualified Wacced out partygoers “It’s different, get him wacced and disqualified” \u003e Wacced out partygoers By saying “It’s different,” Kendrick seems to be suggesting that the wickedness of the hosts and attendees of “the party” is on a totally different level than other negative behavior or even criminal offenses that could be considered forgivable. From Kendrick’s perspective, this different level of wickedness seems to justify getting these partygoers “wacced” and “disqualified.”\n“Wacced” is slang for destroyed, defaced, or disrespected.\nThe use of the word “wacced” would go on to become more notable a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick released the album GNX, which opens with the track “wacced out murals.” On “wacced out murals,” Kendrick expresses anger after an unknown graffiti vandalizer “wacced out” a mural on the side of a Compton restaurant that a visual artist had created to honor Kendrick. The vandalism included Kendrick’s face covered with the letters “OVO,” in reference to Drake’s OVO crew and record label, which is an acronym for “October’s Very Own.”\nYesterday, somebody wacced out my mural\nThat energy’ll make you niggas move to Europe\nBut it’s regular for me, yeah, that’s for sure\nThe love and hate is definite without a cure\nA video of the vandalizer spraying graffiti on Kendrick’s mural was first posted to social media on September 8, 2024, just three days before the release of “Watch the Party Die.” One could reasonably suppose that the release of “Watch the Party Die” on September 11 was partially a response to Kendrick’s mural getting vandalized.\nOne can also reasonably argue that “wacced out murals” is essentially a simplified spiritual successor to “Watch the Party Die.” “wacced out murals” seems crafted to allow listeners to “feel” the vitriol of “Watch the Party Die” without having to closely analyze the lyrics and discover the double entendres. This connection can be seen in the verses of “wacced out murals,” where Kendrick threatens to “eliminate” anyone who is on “the other side” (i.e., not on God’s side). The third verse, in particular, also contains a direct reference to “Watch the Party Die” and to Katt Williams calling for the truth to be exposed.\nIt used to be fuck that nigga, but now it’s plural\nFuck everybody, that’s on my body\nMy blick first, then God got me\n…\nThis is not for lyricists, I swear it’s not the sentiments\nFuck a double entendre, I want y’all to feel this shit\n…\nOkay, nigga, let’s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal\nSince y’all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you\nOkay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die\nNiggas cackling about— while all of y’all is on trial\n…\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\nMake Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ‘bout to get loud\n…\nI know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that’s close to them\nThe niggas that coon, the niggas that bein’ groomed, slide on both of them Someone is typically “disqualified” from an activity or competition when they are exposed for lying, cheating, or behaving in a way that is illegal or unethical. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick could be saying that rappers like Drake should be disqualified from the “rap game” or, more specifically, from the competition of being considered the greatest rapper.\nAt the same time, based on the violent language throughout “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick might also be claiming that the hosts and attendees of “the party” should be disqualified from the most basic activity of living life.\nWe even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives Killing the killers “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Killing the killers Kendrick seems to indicate that he and the people associated with him have already decided to kill anyone who is guilty of killing someone innocent.\nThe first three lines of “Watch the Party Die” have expressed significant amounts of animosity and vitriol. However, this fourth line is the first instance where Kendrick explicitly advocates for death sentences and targeted executions as an act of vigilante justice, where an individual or group without any legal authority decides to take the law into their own hands in order to punish offenders or address perceived injustices. Within the context of this track, Kendrick is establishing himself as the judge and jury while enlisting his supporters to join him as executioners.\nThe idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” brings up a longstanding political, sociological, and philosophical debate about the best way to respond to potential wrongdoing, establish justice, and maintain an orderly society. Within this large debate, it should be noted that more than 50 countries, including the United States of America, currently execute individuals who have been convicted of a crime that the justice system considers particularly egregious or destabilizing to social order.\nIn America, crimes that are eligible for the death penalty tend to be ones that involve intentionally or unintentionally killing someone innocent, whether through murder, terrorism, kidnapping, sexual assault, or drug trafficking. In contrast, European countries in the European Union have abolished the death penalty as a punishment for crimes. However, historically, most civilizations in human history have had some form of the death penalty, often for crimes that did not involve killing anyone—including theft, adultery, sexual misbehavior, disrespecting a member of a higher class, and speaking against the state government or the state religion.\nWhile America and many other modern nations still justify the use of death sentences after a fair trial, all modern nation-states—at least officially—oppose the use of individuals or groups taking the law into their own hands through vigilante justice. However, on an individual basis, many people do seem ready to accept, support, and even celebrate a vigilante execution that is carried out against someone whom they truly despise, even if that person has not broken any laws. Current events “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Current events A few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die,” this inclination for Americans to accept, support, and even celebrate vigilante executions came to the surface after a 26-year-old named Luigi Mangione gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a health insurance company. According to published excerpts from Luigi Mangione’s writings, he claims to have targeted the UnitedHealthcare CEO due to his belief that UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies “have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit.”\nImmediately after the shooting and even before his identity was uncovered, Luigi Mangione became a kind of folk hero as countless people across social media platforms expressed agreement with Mangione’s assessment that “these parasites simply had it coming” and joined the shooter in expressing anger and vitriol against health insurance companies. This sentiment was so widely expressed that Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested, gave a press conference where he said, “In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: he is no hero.”\nOn an international, geopolitical scale, the idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” has also been expressed in the context of war. In 2024, much of this justification has come from many people on both sides of the Israel vs. Hamas conflict that began on October 7, 2023, eleven months before the release of “Watch the Party Die,” after Hamas killed 1,195 Israelis, took 248 Israelis as hostages, and—based on a few sources—sexually assaulted and gang raped numerous Israelis during the October 7 attack. Many people who supported the plight of the Palestinians justified the attack as a necessary response to how Israelis had previously killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Meanwhile, many supporters of Israel’s War in Gaza justified killing the killers of innocent Israelis, even as tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed and two-thirds of Gaza’s buildings were damaged or destroyed.\nWhile “Watch the Party Die” does not specifically address current events such as the War in Gaza and was released months before Luigi Mangione’s vigilante execution, both of these current events reveal the cultural zeitgeist in which Kendrick wrote, recorded, and released “Watch the Party Die.” Kendrick’s catalogue “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Kendrick’s catalogue Kendrick has explored the idea of killing the killers at length in his previous work, most notably on the track “XXX.” from DAMN. On the first verse of “XXX.,” Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) tells a story about a distressed friend who asked for advice on how to respond after gang members killed his son. Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) acknowledged that as an anointed (i.e., Christian) individual, he theoretically knew better but felt strongly that the friend should kill his son’s killer.\nYesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101\nSaid they killed his only son because of insufficient funds\nHe was sobbin’, he was mobbin’, way belligerent and drunk\nTalkin’ out his head, philosophin’ on what the Lord had done\nHe said, “K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me\nI know that you anointed, show me how to overcome”\nHe was lookin’ for some closure, hopin’ I could bring him closer\nTo the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him\n“I can’t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\nAin’t no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward\nI can’t even keep the peace, don’t you fuck with one of ours\nIt be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour\nMeanwhile, the second verse of “XXX.” explored how the inclination toward violence and killing the killers is a common pattern of thought within the American psyche, in contrast to the mentality that was exemplified by Jesus.\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\nPass the gin, I mix it with American blood\nThen bash him in, you Crippin’ or you married to Blood?\nI’ll ask again, oops, accident\nIt’s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmerica’s reflections of me, that’s what a mirror does It is also notable that on “Worldwide Steppers” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick asserted that we are all killers who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, cause the deaths of innocent people.\nI’m a killer, he’s a killer, she’s a killer, bitch\nWe some killers, walkin’ zombies, tryna scratch that itch\n..\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology\nSilent murderer, what’s your body count? Who your sponsorship?\nObjectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)\nThe media’s the new religion, you killed the consciousness (What the fuck?)\nYour jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)\nNiggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)\n..\nI caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community\nMy last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies\nNot because the rags in the park had red gradient\nBut because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin’\nSo what’s the difference ’tween your life when hiding motives?\nMore fatalities and reality bring you closure\nThe noble person that goes to work and pray like they ‘posed to?\nSlaughter people too, your murder’s just a bit slower\nIf we apply the logic of “Worldwide Steppers” to this current line on “Watch the Party Die,” the natural conclusion would suggest that beyond the powerful men who exploit, coerce, and sexually abuse victims at parties, there is a much wider set of people whom Kendrick could justifiably kill through his vigilante executions.\nAt the same time, we should note that on “Worldwide Steppers,” Kendrick first and foremost acknowledges that he himself is a killer, in part due to his catering choices, which might lead innocent children to long-term health complications and shortened lifespans. If we apply that logic from “Worldwide Steppers” to this line from “Watch the Party Die,” it would seem that Kendrick is being a hypocrite for justifying his desire to kill the people whom he despises while not acknowledging that he also deserves to be killed.\nIn contrast, on “Die for the Party,” Lecrae looks at the man in the mirror, sees that he himself is a killer and a hypocrite, which leads him to acknowledge that he deserves death along with all the other hypocrites.\nIt’s killers sittin’ in they cell for takin’ somebody innocent\nAnd they don’t even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance\nBut when I take a look in the mirror\nThe blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters\nI’m that- who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I’m that sinner\nI deserve death along with all these liars and hypocrites Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time Justification “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Justification Burning the whole village with men, women, and children would normally be seen as an act of injustice and inhumane brutality. However, if everyone is a killer, Kendrick seems to have no issue with any collateral damage that he would cause while trying to exterminate the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party.”\nThe justification for burning the whole village naturally follows from the idea that we are all killers and the idea that we should kill the killers who like taking innocent lives.\nBy saying “it’s really that time,” Kendrick connects the idea of burning the whole village to the opening line, “I think it’s time to watch the party die.” Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament From a biblical perspective, the idea of a whole village being burned does bring to mind the Old Testament story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where two towns of rapists were destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies, as I mentioned in the “Wicked sexual misbehavior in the Bible” section.\nThe motif of fire coming down from the sky gets further developed in the stories about the Prophet Elijah, who served as a prophet to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had its capital in a city called Samaria.\nAround 50 years earlier, the Northern Kingdom of Israel, with its capital in Samaria, had split from the Southern Kingdom of Judah, with its capital in Jerusalem, after a rebellion and a near civil war.\nThis split would be the beginning of an animosity between Samaria and Judah that would continue to escalate for centuries.\nIn English, the name Judah was later shortened to the word “Jew,” which is the word that is now used to refer to the ethnic group that is originally from this geographic area and the religion that was originally practiced by this ethnic group.\nAt the time, Israel had almost entirely turned away from worshiping God and was instead worshiping a fertility and sex god named Ba’al. As part of the worship of this fertility god, the Israelites presumably would have been going to the god Ba’al’s temple to participate in feasts and have ritualized sex with temple prostitutes.\nThe worship of Ba’al was introduced to the Kingdom of Israel by a king named Ahab, who “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” King Ahab married a princess named Jezebel from one of the neighboring nations, which God had specifically forbidden the Israelites from entering into marriage relationships with because those nations worshiped false gods like the fertility god Ba’al.\nAccording to a prophecy from Elijah, God stopped the sky from raining any water to prove that worshiping the fertility and sex god Ba’al would actually diminish the land’s agricultural fertility and, as a consequence, also diminish the sexual fertility among the Israelites. This prophecy angered King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, who then unsuccessfully tried to murder Elijah.\nAt some point after Ahab’s son succeeded Ahab as king, God sent Elijah to confront the king about the ongoing worship of Ba’al. The king sent a military captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah. However, Elijah called down fire from the skies, which came down and burned the captain and all the soldiers to death. The king then sent another captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah, but they too were burned to death when Elijah called down fire from the skies. Finally, a last captain of fifty soldiers came and humbled himself before Elijah, who this time did not call down fire on the soldiers. (See 2 Kings 1:1-15) Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament Given the motif of fire raining down from the skies to destroy the wicked in the Old Testament, it is notable that one particular New Testament story in St. Luke’s account of the Gospel (aka “Good News”) seems to intentionally undermine the desire one might have for God to send fire to destroy one’s enemies. (See Luke 9:52-56)\nIn that story, Jesus and his disciples go to a village in Samaria, the same city where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had long ago led the Israelites to worship the fertility and sex god Ba’al.\nDuring the time of Jesus, the people of Samaria did worship Yahweh, the God of Israel, but the Samaritans and the Judeans considered each other to be enemies because:\nThe Judeans considered the Samaritans to be “heretics” who did not worship Yahweh in the way that Yahweh was supposed to be worshiped.\nAbout 550 years earlier, the Samaritans had tried to prevent the Judeans from building a temple in Jerusalem.\nAbout 140 years earlier, there was a military campaign in which the Judeans from Jerusalem destroyed the Samaritan’s temple to Yahweh, killed lots of people, and destroyed their capital city. As Jesus entered the Samaritan village, Jesus’s followers announced him as the rightful king of the Judeans, who was on his way to Jerusalem to be crowned and enthroned as king. However, due to the longstanding hatred between Judeans and Samaritans, the Samaritans did not accept Jesus and expressed visible hostility to Jesus’s arrival.\nTwo of Jesus’s disciples, St. James and St. John, seemed to have been greatly displeased by the cold reception that the Samaritans were giving to Jesus. Likely influenced by their own hatred of the Samaritans, Jesus’s two disciples asked Jesus:\n“Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” Jesus immediately became angry with those two disciples and strongly criticized them by saying:\n“You do not know what kind of spirit you belong to. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy human lives, but to [save / rescue / heal] them.”\nNote: The term “Son of Man” is how Jesus typically referred to himself in the Gospel accounts (See the Bible Project Son of Man video).\nBy expressing his desire to “burn the whole village,” Kendrick seems to be exhibiting the same misguided way of thought as the disciples who wanted to destroy their enemies in the name of serving Jesus. In doing so, James, John, and Kendrick totally disregarded Jesus’s desire to have his enemies apologize, repent, and allow Jesus to save, rescue, and heal their lives.\nCurrent events “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Current events Within the context of current events in 2024, one can also see the Israeli military action against Hamas and the resulting damage or destruction of two thirds of buildings in Gaza an example of the Israeli government deciding that it is justifable to “burn the whole village” in order to kill the killers who executed the October 7, 2023 attack. Why reason with these niggas if they can't see the future first?\nWhy argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work? Justification “Why reason…Why reason…” \u003e Justification Kendrick seems to claim that it is futile to use reason or rational arguments to convince the wicked party hosts and attendees to change their ways. These statements seem to provide further justification for his desire to kill anyone who has taken innocent lives. Future first “Why reason with these niggas if they can’t see the future first?” \u003e Future first The phrase “see the future first” could be a reference to Frank Ocean’s track, “Nikes.”\nWe’ll let you guys prophesy\nWe gon’ see the future first\nLiving so the last night feels like a past life\nSpeakin’ of the, don’t know what got into people\nDevil be possessin homies\nDemons try to body jump In the context of “Nikes,” the people who “see the future first” seem to be the ones who truly have a prophetic vision. These true prophets stand in contrast to those who talk as if they can prophesy but are not actually able to see the future in advance.\nKendrick has repeatedly identified himself as a prophet, most prominently on the final track of To Pimp a Butterfly and on several tracks that were released in subsequent years.\nI freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain’t a prophet ’til they ask you this question\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n-“Mortal Man”\nThe reason my power’s here on earth\nSalute the truth, when the prophet say\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\n-“DNA.”\nI’m not a trending topic, I’m a prophet\nI answer to Metatron and Gabriel\n-“family ties” In the third verse of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick also seems to compare himself and the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry to the biblical prophet Elijah and the wicked Queen Jezebel, who tried to imprison and kill all the true prophets of God who spoke truth while giving prominent positions to false prophets who told lies.\nIt’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified\nThe end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies Hence, we could interpret the current line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to reason with rappers and members of the entertainment industry who profit from telling lies.\nCircus clowns “Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work?” \u003e Circus clowns The word “clown” is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who acts foolishly in a way that attracts a lot of attention.\nThe word “circus” can also be used as a pejorative to describe an environment that is overcrowded, noisy, and chaotic. This pejorative meaning of the word “circus” could potentially be used to describe the “party,” particularly since a party and a circus are both forms of communal entertainment.\nHence, we could interpret this line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to argue with the rappers and members of the entertainment industry who are working for the circus. Just walk that man down, that’ll do everyone a solid Walk down “Just walk that man down, that’ll do everyone a solid” \u003e Walk down “Walking someone down” is a slang term that refers to premeditated murder, particularly in a shooting where the shooter calmly executes his target.\nIn “euphoria,” Kendrick confronts Drake while rapping:\nHave you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?\nHere in “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to be inciting his supporters to kill the killers who like taking innocent lives. Kendrick justifies such murders by saying it will “do everyone a solid,” which is a colloquial way of saying that killing such people will do everyone a favor.\nSimilar to the earlier line where Kendrick said “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives”, it seems appropriate to point out that a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die,” this logic was used by significant numbers of people to justify Luigi Mangione’s decision to kill the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. For example, in one popular video, the host defends the shooter’s actions and fittingly refers to the shooter as “Run ’em down Jake” prior to the shooter’s name being discovered and publicized.\nIt’s love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence Tough love “It’s love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence” \u003e Tough love The term “tough love” is stereotypically used by parents (particularly dads) to refer to painful discipline that is meant to benefit a child in the long run.\nKendrick specifically mentions “tough love” to describe the parenting Kendrick received from his father on the Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers track “Father Time.”\nDaddy issues ball across my head, told me, “Fuck a foul”\nI’m teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won’t think out loud …\nDaddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don’t take those well\nMomma said, “That boy is exhausted,” he said, “Go fuck yourself\nIf he give up now, that’s gon’ cost him, life’s a bitch\nYou could be a bitch or step out the margin,” I got up quick\nI’m chargin’ baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance\nOh, this the part where mental stability meets talent\nOh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice\nTactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues\n…\nEarly mornin’ wake-ups (Ah), practicin’ on day-offs (Ah)\nTough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)\n…\nI got daddy issues, that’s on me\nLookin’ for, “I love you”, rarely empathizin’ for my relief\nA child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee\n‘Cause if I cried about it, he’d surely tell me not to be weak\nDaddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself\nMen should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped It is notable that “Father Time” is one of the few tracks where Kendrick mentioned Drake by name prior to the feud.\nDaddy issues kept me competitive, that’s a fact, nigga\nI don’t give a fuck what’s the narrative, I am that nigga\nWhen Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused\nGuess I’m not mature as I think, got some healin’ to do Given that on “Father Time” Kendrick highlighted how “tough love” can instill unhealthy patterns of thought and lead to immature competitiveness, it is ironic and inconsistent for Kendrick to justify the use of violence against his enemies by claiming it is a result of “tough love.\"\nKendrick also hinted at the idea of tough love leading to violence on “euphoria” when he alluded to rapper YNW Melly. YNW Melly, whose legal last name is ironically “Demons,” released a hit single called “Murder on My Mind” in June 2018, just a few months before a shooting in which he was later accused of murdering two of his close friends, rappers YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.\nIt’s three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin’ and huggin’ on stage\nI love ’em to death and in eight bars, I’ll explain that phrase, huh\n…\nI pray they my real friends, if not, I’m YNW Melly If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth\nThe graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose Gluttony “If you parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” \u003e Gluttony Kendrick now seems to be targeting rappers, social media influencers, and other members of the entertainment industry who glorify greed, instant gratification, and conspicuous, unhealthy consumption, particularly when such individuals never actually offer truth to innocent youth whose lives may be shortened if they imitate the examples that are given to them by the entertainment industry.\nKendrick has discussed the theme of unhealthy consumption throughout his career.\nThe track “Vanity Slaves” from the Kendrick Lamar EP explores the ways in which Black people in America have become enslaved to White-owned businesses and corporations that lead Black people into financial mismanagement and ruin. From this perspective, Kendrick could make a compelling case that parading gluttony leads to generational racial injustice that dehumanizes Black people much like slavery.\nI care about my pride too much\nIf my clothes is new, if my ride is plush\nIf my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed\nI look in the mirror, I’m trendy enough? Wrong\nInsecurity roams the black community\nHomes where kids must have jewelry\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt’s not about the right price but more like the right scam\nTo rule us all, confuse us all\nHit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw\nNow let’s draw\nThe picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for\nMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a house\nThat lives around his neck like a white collar\nSo why fast forward? Then I’ll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times\nPickin’ cotton from a field that a white man own\nThe blacker you are farther you from the white man’s home\nNegro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity\nBefore your vanity, they parted our families\nThey put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed\nThe more we were afraid, the more they made rules\nAnd trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague\n…\nRemember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot\nCalled us niggers and figured that we’d never live in pursuit\nOf happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do\nThought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to\nAbout a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie\nHer hand bag gotta be Gucci, it’s fake then she fool me\nShe still bad though and her fake Gucci ain’t that bad though\nWe fillin’ up the gas for Rollies\nUpgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin’ Kobes\nMy cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya\nHe overcompensate for the life of his ancestors\nSo blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw\nThe reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss\nSlaves\n…\nI said the four-hundred years we never had nothin’\nBarely had clothes on our back\nIs the reason why when we get a little bit of change\nWe over exaggerate on our livin’ expenses\nSo if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house\nYou’re a vanity slave\nIf you’re a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger\nFour holes in your left ear and a nose piercin’\nYou’re a vanity slave\nIf you got an ‘02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it\nAnd on the back of the window it says, “Get on my level, ho”\nYou’re a vanity slave\nWe all vanity slaves On the track “Alright,” followed by “For Sale? (Interlude)” on To Pimp a Butterfly, parading gluttony to tempt young Black people is a satanic plot that is utilized by Lucy (aka Lucifer / the satan / the devil / the false accuser / the adversary / the diabolical one).\nWhat you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?\nForty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I’m your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it’s illegal\nI don’t think about it, I deposit every other zero\nThinkin’ of my partner, put the candy paintin’ on the Regal\nDiggin’ in my pocket, ain’t a profit big enough to feed you\nEvery day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you\nIn the presence of your chico, ah\n-“Alright” My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick\nUsually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick\nLucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories\nAbout these rappers that I came after when they was boring\nLucy gon’ fill your pockets\nLucy gon’ move your mama out of Compton\nInside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised\nLucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?\nIt’s not so easy, I’m at these functions accordingly\n-“For Sale (Interlude)” On “LUST.,” Kendrick raps from the perspective of a man and a woman who are being controlled by demonic forces and driven toward an endless routine of conspicuous, unhealthy consumption. Within the logic of “LUST.,” demonic forces seem to be at work under the surface in ways that we normally don’t notice, and thus don’t realize how Black people are being enslaved in a way that is arguably too wicked to apologize for.\nWake up in the mornin’, thinkin’ ‘bout money, kick your feet up\nWatch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up\nGo hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don’t go to work today\nCop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today\nHang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama\nSip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window\nBet your favorite team, play you some Madden\nGo to the club or your mama house\nWhatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water) Wake up in the morning, thinking ‘bout money, kick your feet up\nHop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up\nTouch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain’t shit\nCredit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent\nHop on the ‘Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin’ on you\nPop you a pill, call up your bitches, have ’em waitin’ on you\nGo to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce\nIt’s whatever, just make it count At the end of “LUST.,” Kendrick references a New Testament Bible passage that speaks directly to the dangers of being controlled by gluttony and lust.\nLately, in James 4:4 says\n“Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord”\nBrace yourself: Lust is all yours James 4:4 refers to a section of teaching that St. James, the stepbrother of Jesus, gave to Christians who were getting into conflicts because of their lust, gluttony, and desire for all the material possessions that can be obtained in this world. St. James warns these Christians that living in this way leads to pride (i.e., exalting themselves above others to get what they want). Moreover, St. James warns that those who become proud become enemies of God, who opposes those who are proud and gives grace to those who are humble.\nWhere do wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your body parts? You lust, and do not have. You murder and want what someone else has, and can’t obtain it. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires. You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Therefore submit yourself to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you inconsistent people. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. Graveyard “The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose” \u003e Graveyard By saying, “The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose,” Kendrick is asserting that those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” are guaranteed to be executed alongside the killers who “like taking innocent lives.”\nSince their deaths are all but certain, Kendrick cold-heartedly recommends that these people should make plans for their own funeral. Since these people have been so consumed by their own vanity for commercialized products, Kendrick seems to suggest that they should take the time to pick the casket that will allow them to take their vanity to the grave. They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card Scamming “They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card” \u003e Scamming On a few tracks over the years, Kendrick has pointed out the destructive pattern of Black people using credit card scams to illegally get money to pay for their unhealthy consumption habits, addictions, or desire to be lazy.\nBaby wanna go back to school, but she need some help\nBecause it’s hard trying to pay the bills when you’re by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams, ’til she heard a voice\nThat said, “The Devil is a lie, make a better choice”\n-“Faith”\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt’s not about the right price but more like the right scam\n-\"“Vanity Slaves”\"\nCredit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent\n-“LUST.” Chipped “They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card” \u003e Chipped Getting “chipped” is a slang term for getting killed, particularly by gunshots that are fired to put an end to a conflict, as can be heard in several of Kendrick’s past tracks.\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\n…\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\n…\nLet somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman\nTouch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother\nYou should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\n-“XXX.”\nI come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor\nRebellious and Margielas’ll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\n-“The Heart Part 5”\nHellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay\nEverybody wanna be demon ’til they get chipped by a throwaway\n-“euphoria” In the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to be saying that rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “glorify scamming” will soon get “chipped” by the people who are carrying out Kendrick’s execution orders.\nInfluencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit Influencers “Influencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit” \u003e Influencers Here, Kendrick seems to be criticizing social media influencers who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth.” These influencers are often followed by thousands or even millions of impressionable young people. Once they amass a significant number of followers, these particular influencers profit from convincing young people that they need to buy sponsored products, which may then lead young people to steal money through credit card scams.\nIt is worth noting that in the years prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die,” several social science research studies published papers that found connections between materialistic social media content and problematic consumption behavior among young people.\nTo further magnify their influence, these influencers seem to have a pattern of exalting themselves so that they can “talk down” to people like Kendrick. Basic “Influencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit” \u003e Basic In slang usage, the word “basic” is a pejorative that describes something that is mainstream, popular, and trending, or someone who is unrefined and boring because they only like things that are mainstream, popular, and trending.\nFor Kendrick, “basic shit” from the mainstream entertainment industry seems to be the exact opposite of the thoughtful, complex, and creative artistry that has defined Kendrick’s career—most notably with Kendrick’s album DAMN. winning a Pulitzer Prize.\nOn the track “Poetic Justice” (featuring Drake) from good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick highlights how finding someone who is not “basic” is as rare as finding a flower that bloomed in a dark room.\nI recognize your fragrance, hol’ up, you ain’t never gotta say shit, uh\nAnd I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh\nEverybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis\nWith poetic justice, poetic justice\nIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? But they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent Hate “But they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent” \u003e Hate Kendrick claims that he constantly receives hate from “basic” influencers who cannot understand or appreciate his thoughtful, complex, and creative artistry. However, Kendrick doesn’t take this hate personally. From Kendrick’s perspective, “basic” influencers hate everything that he represents in contrast to the mainstream entertainment industry. The type of man that never dickride ‘cause I want a favor Dickride “The type of man that never dickride ‘cause I want a favor” \u003e Dickride Within the entertainment industry, Kendrick sees himself as representing the kind of man who never “dickrides.” In slang usage, “dickriding” refers to the act of saying an excessive and unwarranted amount of good things about an important person in order to benefit by receiving favorable treatment from that important person.\nWhile the term “dickriding” is most often used metaphorically to describe someone who says an excessive amount of good things to gain favor, the most literal usage of the term refers to a man or woman who willingly receives anal or vaginal sexual penetration from a powerful man in order to receive favorable treatment or economic opportunities.\nIt is notable that in the viral Club Shay Shay interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00), Katt Williams highlighted how from the start of his career in the entertainment industry, his entire goal was to become successful without ever literally or metaphorically riding anyone’s dick.\nMy goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked a penis. That was my only goal.\n…\nI’ve had to turn down $50 million four times - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, “No.” You’ve got to tell him, “No.” I did. The man that resides in patience Patience “The man that resides in patience” \u003e Patience While “dickriding” can be a quick way to achieve some level of success, Kendrick seems to see himself as someone who has the patience needed to reap the rewards of hard-earned success. So where the soldiers at—\nthe one's that lost it all\nand learned to learn from that— Soldiers who learned from a loss “So where the soldiers at…lost it all and learned to learn from that?” \u003e Soldiers who learned from a loss In contrast to men who “dickride” and are “with the basic shit,” Kendrick seems to be highlighting the kinds of rare character traits and behaviors that he wants his people to nurture, particularly self-improvement, education, hard work, financial stability, and a desire or thirst for things that will lead to life.\nThese are traits and behaviors that are often best developed during childhood and adolescence and thus would be at risk if rappers, influencers, or members of the entertainment industry are allowed to “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth.”\nMore specifically, Kendrick is looking for the rare men who have the mentality of soldiers who lost everything in battle but found a way to learn invaluable life lessons from those losses.\nWithin the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick could be looking to recruit these soldiers to be his executioners.\nOn “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick mentioned that the ability to learn from a loss is something that he did not receive from how his own father parented him, but it is a blessing that Kendrick wants his loved ones to receive.\nDaddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don’t take those well\n-“Father Time”\nI bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive\nI bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal\nI bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact\nA patient life, flaws, bless ’em twice, and they’ll bless you back\n-“Purple Hearts” a thirst for life, head inside a book\n‘cause he concerned with that— Thirst “a thirst for life, head inside a book ‘cause he concerned with that” \u003e Thirst Thirst is a concept that Kendrick mentioned on the latter half of the pivotal track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from good kid, m.A.A.d city. On that track, Kendrick described how a life of gluttony led him and others to be overcome by a deep spiritual thirst.\nHow many sins, oh? I’m runnin’ out, oh\nHow many sins, oh? I lost count\nDreams of ballin’ like Spalding\nBut only shotty bounce, oh\nThe reaper callin’, oh, I’m cottonmouth, oh\nMoney is power (Money is power)\nYours is ours (Yours is ours)\nLay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh\nHope we get rich, oh, hope we can tower\nOver the city with vanity with the music louder, oh\n…\nToo many sins, oh, I’m runnin’ out, oh\nSomebody send me a well for the drought, oh\nSee all I know, oh, is takin’ notes\nOn takin’ this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh\nMy best days, oh, I stress days\n(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)\nMy best days, oh, I stress days, oh\nSay “fuck the world”, oh, my sex slave, oh\nMoney, pussy, and greed—what’s my next crave?\nWhatever it is, know it’s my next grave, oh\nTired of runnin’, tired of runnin’, tired of tumblin’\nTired of runnin’, oh, tired of tumblin’, backwards\nMy momma say “See, a pastor give me a promise\nWhat if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?\nThe truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest\nYou dyin’ of thirst, you dyin’ of thirst\nSo hop in that water, and pray that it works.\nOn the track “LUST.” from DAMN., Kendrick seems to allude to the experience of “dying of thirst” as he reveals the demonic influence that is driving people toward greed, conspicuous consumption, and the need for “holy water.”\nI need some water\nSomething came over me\nWay too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat During a skit at the end of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst,” an older Christian woman sees that Kendrick and his friends were “dying of thirst” because their sadness and anger were driving them toward killing their enemies and putting their own lives at risk. She tells them that their thirst for blood and violence was really a spiritual thirst that could only be satisfied by “holy water,” being baptized by the Spirit of the Lord, and receiving a new kind of life from Jesus.\nYoung man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?\nI know that’s not what I think that is\nWhy are you so angry?\nSee, you young men are dying of thirst\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means you need water, holy water\nYou need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord\nDo you want to receive God as your personal savior?\nOkay, repeat after me:\n“Lord God, I come to You a sinner”\n“And I humbly repent for my sins”\n“I believe that Jesus is Lord”\n“I believe You raised Him from the dead”\n“I would ask that Jesus come into my life”\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus\nFor saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life. The older Christian woman’s conclusion that Kendrick and his friends are dying of thirst and need holy water seems to come from a scene in St. John’s account of the Gospel. In that scene, Jesus stops to rest in a village inhabited by people from an ethnic group called the Samaritans, who were enemies of the Judean ethnic group to which Jesus belonged. Instead of calling down fire from heaven to burn up the Samaritan village, Jesus starts a conversation with a Samaritan woman who is drawing water from a well. Jesus tells the woman that he could give her “living water,” which would satisfy her so completely that she would never thirst again.\nJesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.\nSo the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Judean, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans).\nJesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”\nShe said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”\n-John 4:5,7-14 Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, as Jesus repeats his offer of “living water” to a crowd of people at a holiday feast, St. John explains that the “living water” which Jesus speaks about is actually the “Holy Spirit.” Jesus would give the “Holy Spirit” to his disciples so that his disciples would be filled with new patterns of thoughts and emotions that would empower them to live a new kind of life.\nNow on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”\nThis He said in reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive.\n-John 7:37-39\nIn St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells the sister of his dead friend that “I am the resurrection and the life.” Jesus then goes on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See John 11:1-45).\nIn that same Gospel account, Jesus also tells his disciples, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (See John 14:2-6).\nWhen applied to this line on “Watch the Party Die,” the belief that Jesus is “the life” and the giver of “living water” implies that a “thirst for life” is truly a “thirst for Jesus.” Moreover, those who “thirst for life” discover that Jesus can satisfy their deepest thirst when they read the stories about Jesus in the “Good Book,” aka the Holy Bible.\ninformation that'll change his life\nbecause he yearns for that—\ndedication, findin' out what's right\n‘cause he can earn from that? Finding out what’s right “findin’ out what’s right ‘cause he can earn from that?” \u003e Finding out what’s right Kendrick seems to highlight the virtue of individuals who know that they will earn a reward when they do the right thing, which motivates them to read books and seek information to help them find out what is right. These individuals stand in contrast to people who “dickride” because they want a favor. I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd shit\nCan't blame them, today they ain't really got much to work with\nHow many bitches harder than a lot of you niggas?\nWould trade all of y’all for Nip, I can’t be proud of you niggas Clowns and nerds “I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd shit” \u003e Clowns and nerds Kendrick seems to be asserting that the vast majority of men currently have not developed the kind of virtuous traits or behaviors that he described in the previous lines. As a result, most women who are looking for respectable partners must put up with immature and soft clowns and nerds who do not know how to behave like real men. Nipsey Hussle “Would trade all of y’all for Nip, I can’t be proud of you niggas” \u003e Nipsey Hussle In contrast to rappers who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth,” Kendrick expresses his sadness at the loss of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved South Central rapper who was murdered in March of 2019. Nipsey’s murder was particularly tragic because Nipsey had shown a remarkable commitment, vision, ingenuity, entrepreneurship, business acumen, and diplomacy in his efforts to improve his local community.\nNipsey started a community co-working space named Vector 90, which provided opportunities for Black youth in Crenshaw to take science, technology, engineering, and math courses and develop as entrepreneurs.\nNipsey was closely involved in the planning and advisory stages of an open-air museum called Destination Crenshaw, which was designed to showcase the history and culture of Black people in his neighborhood.\nNipsey arranged meetings with the Los Angeles Police Department to discuss ways to stop gang violence.\nAfter Nipsey’s death, former President Barack Obama wrote a tribute that said:\nWhile most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it – to build a skills training center and a coworking space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow – is a legacy worthy of celebration. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it. [Chorus] God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace Kendrick’s prayers “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e Kendrick’s prayers In contrast to the verses of “Watch the Party Die,” which seem to be persuasive rhetoric addressed to those who will support Kendrick’s campaign of vigilante executions, the chorus seems to be a prayer that is addressed to God.\nThe idea of praying to God is a recurring motif in Kendrick’s work, going all the way back to the track “Faith” on Kendrick’s first project under the name Kendrick Lamar, the 2009 Kendrick Lamar EP.\nI found myself losing focus at a Sunday service\nEmbarrassed so I start questioning God, “What is my purpose?”\nHe said to live the way he did, that’s all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian\nAnd this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man, I can’t help but give in In 2012, Kendrick used his major label debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, to tell the backstory of how he first became a Christian. The album’s first track, “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter,” begins with Kendrick and his homies saying a version of the “Sinner’s Prayer” to receive Jesus as their “personal savior.” This prayer is later heard within the narrative context during the pivotal moment in “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” when an older Christian woman approaches Kendrick and his homies and implores them to start a new way of life after Kendrick’s friend Dave was killed in a gang shootout.\nYoung man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?\nI know that’s not what I think that is\nWhy are you so angry?\nSee, you young men are dying of thirst\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means you need water, holy water\nYou need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord\nDo you want to receive God as your personal savior?\nOkay, repeat after me:\n“Lord God, I come to You a sinner”\n“And I humbly repent for my sins”\n“I believe that Jesus is Lord”\n“I believe You raised Him from the dead”\n“I would ask that Jesus come into my life”\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”*\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life*. On Kendrick’s second major label album, To Pimp a Butterfly, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of Lucy (aka Lucifer / the devil / the satan / the false accuser / the diabolical one). Lucy acknowledges that she heard Kendrick saying the “Sinner’s Prayer” to God the Father on good kid, m.A.A.d city, but is nonetheless confident that Kendrick would abandon God and pursue Lucy.\nYou said Sherane ain’t got nothing on Lucy\n…\nKendrick, Lucy don’t slack a minute, Lucy work harder\nLucy gon’ call you even when Lucy know you love your Father\nI’m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly\nLucy don’t mind, ‘cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me On Kendrick’s third major label album, DAMN., Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) repeatedly expressed feelings of sadness and frustration because he felt that nobody was praying for him. Then, during the album’s pivotal track, “FEAR.,” Kendrick’s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail explaining that Kendrick’s feelings of sadness and frustration were not due to a lack of people praying for him but were instead due to Kendrick’s own lack of faithfulness in following the Lord’s commandments.\nNew Kung Fu Kenny\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\n…\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n-“ELEMENT.” Shit, I feel like—\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’\n…\nI feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me?*\n-“FEEL.” Nobody pray for me\nIt been that day for me\n-“HUMBLE.” What’s up, family?\nYeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man\nI know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately\nAnd I know you feel like, you know\nPeople ain’t been prayin’ for you\nBut you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people.\nDeuteronomy 28:28 says,\n“The Lord shall smite thee with madness\nAnd blindness, and astonishment of heart”\nSee, family, that’s why you feel like you feel\nLike you got a chip on your shoulder\nUntil you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\n-“FEAR.” On Kendrick’s fourth major label album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick seemed to depict himself as being—at least temporarily—distant from God and detached from his identity as a Christian while exploring alternative spiritual practices, including praying to flowers and trees.\nYesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees\nGratification to the powers that be\n…\nThe noble person that goes to work and pray like they ‘posed to\nSlaughter people too*, your murder’s just a bit slower*\n-“Worldwide Steppers” Where’s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today\nI transformed, prayin’ to the trees, God is taking shape\n…\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract On Kendrick’s first battle track, “euphoria,” Kendrick implied that Drake was an absentee father while rapping about his own role as a father, including the responsibility of teaching one’s son to pray.\nWhy would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y’all think all my life is rap?\nThat’s ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that\nWakin’ him up, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nThen tell him to pray, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nThen givin’ him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nTeachin’ him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that\nSpeakin’ the truth and consider what God’s considerin’, you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that On Kendrick’s second battle record, “6:16 in LA,” Kendrick spoke directly to God while seemingly confessing that he was engaging in the battle with Drake in part because his identity was wrapped up in being a soldier who needs to go to war in order to have a stable identity.\nWho could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom\nGod, ah, my confession is yours\nBut, who am I if I don’t go to war? The Lord’s Prayer “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e The Lord’s Prayer The idea of a person praying for God to give them what they truly need is one of the central points of the most famous and universal Christian prayer, which is known as the “Lord’s Prayer.” Those who pray the Lord’s Prayer ask for God the Father to give them their “daily bread” in reference to the essential physical and spiritual needs on a daily basis in order to live.\nOur Father, who is in heaven,\nhallowed be Your name.\nYour Kingdom come.\nYour will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread,\nand forgive us our tresspasses,\nas we forgive those who trespass against us,\nand lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one. The idea of “bread” being symbolic of the things that someone needs to live is further explored in a story where Jesus multiplies five loaves of bread in order to feed five thousand men and their families (See Matthew 14:13-21 or John 6:1-15).\nLater, after a crowd of those who ate the multiplied bread began to focus exclusively on their desire for Jesus to fulfill their physical hunger for earthly bread, Jesus told the crowd that he himself is the spiritual “bread of life” and that anyone who eats Jesus as the “bread of life” will live forever.\nJesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.\n-Matthew 6:35,40,48-58 Later, just before Jesus was arrested and executed on a cross, he shared a meal of bread and wine with his disciples and told them that the bread was his body and the wine was his blood. This particular meal of Jesus’s disciples eating bread as Jesus’s body and drinking wine as Jesus’s blood became the most central Christian spiritual practice, known as the “Communion,” the “Eucharist,” or the “Lord’s Supper.”\n*Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and **gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.”*And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the [covenant / agreement], which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. Hence, if we see Kendrick’s prayer during the chorus of “Watch the Party Die” as an echo of the Lord’s Prayer, we could conclude that what Kendrick truly needs to receive is Jesus himself and the new way of life that comes from living in close communion with Jesus. This is the same conclusion that was presented to Kendrick when the older Christian woman convinced Kendrick and his homies not to kill their enemies and instead led them to say the “Sinner’s Prayer” at the end of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.”\n”I would ask that Jesus come into my life\"\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus for saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life. God-given life “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e God-given life In addition to referring to himself as the “bread of life,” Jesus also describes himself as “the life” on a few other occasions in St. John’s account of the Gospel.\nAfter one of Jesus’s friends died, Jesus told the sister of the friend, “I am the resurrection and the life.” Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See John 11:1-45).\nIn that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (See John 14:2-6). Throughout St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus repeatedly teaches that he came to earth not to kill or destroy humans but to give “eternal life” to all those who would listen to his teaching and believe in him.\nThe Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.\n-John 3:14-17\nThe one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life.\n-John 3:36\nJesus answered and said to the Samaritan woman, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”\n-John 4:13-14\nThe one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life.*\n-John 4:36\nTruly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\n-John 5:24\nYou examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.\n-John 5:39-40\n*Do not work for the food that perishes, but *work for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.\n-John 6:27\nFor this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.\n-John 6:40\nTruly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.\n-John 6:47-51\nTruly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\n-John 6:53-54\nMy sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.\n-John 10:27-28\nThe one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.\n-John 12:25\nThe Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life.\n-John 12:49-50 All of these teachings about “eternal life” lead up to a culminating prayer in which Jesus talks directly to God the Father and declares that “eternal life” is the experience of knowing God the Father and Jesus as the Son of God in a close relationship.\nJesus spoke these things; and raising His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, so that the Son may glorify You, just as You gave Him authority over all humanity, so that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life. this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.\n-John 17:1-3 Hence, when Kendrick prays, “God, give me life,” Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is life. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about love and forgiveness so that Kendrick can judge and execute the very same people whom Jesus came to offer eternal life.\nGod-given peace “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e God-given peace Just before he was arrested and executed, Jesus gave one final teaching to his disciples. In that final teaching, Jesus said that he was giving “peace” to his disciples. Moreover, Jesus clarified that he himself is the peace that he was giving to his disciples. The disciples would receive this peace by listening to Jesus’ words and remaining in a close relationship with him.\nPeace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression, but be of good courage for I have overcome the world.\n-John 14:27, 16:33 Also, in Jesus’s most famous collection of teachings, he declared that his disciples would be blessed with a close relationship with God the Father when they serve as peacemakers in the world.\nBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. -Matthew 5:9 Hence, when Kendrick prays, “Dear God, please give me peace,” Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is peace. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about being a peacemaker so that Kendrick can try to overcome the evils of the world through violence.\nDear God, please keep these lame niggas away from me Keep away from me “Dear God, please keep these lame niggas away from me’” \u003e Keep away from me In slang, the word “lame” refers to anything that is not cool, refined, or worthy of honor.\nKendrick’s prayer to keep “these lame niggas away” seems to echo the end of the Lord’s Prayer, which asks God the Father to lead his people away from tempting situations and away from the “evil one,” in reference to the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].\nLead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. By praying to “keep these lame niggas away from me,” Kendrick seems to be asserting that these “lame niggas” are members of “the other side,” which is opposed to “God’s side.” If Kendrick were to follow the example of Jesus and the early Christians, he would be praying to transform these “lame niggas” so that they could repent, apologize, and come to “God’s side.”\nDear God, keep me shinin' Shining “Dear God, keep me shinin’” \u003e Shining In hip-hop terminology, “shining” refers to wearing gaudy amounts of expensive, shiny diamond jewelry or otherwise making public displays of one’s success, wealth, and power.\nGiven that Kendrick earlier expressed his desire to kill rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth,” it is likely that Kendrick is not asking God to give him shiny jewelry.\nSimilar to the previous requests for life and peace, it seems more likely that Kendrick is making a request for spiritual well-being rather than material or financial well-being.\nIn biblical terminology, “shining” refers to the way in which people who follow God’s commandments serve as a bright example of how other humans should live.\nIn the introduction to St. John’s account of the Gospel, St. John introduces Jesus by saying that Jesus is the “true light” who has existed even before the universe was created. Moreover, St. John asserts that through Jesus’s birth as a human, the “light” has now come down from the skies to “shine” on humans and penetrate through the darkness of human wickedness.\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome it…the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a crowd of listeners that he is the “light of the world,” and that humans can follow him so that they may find the light of life and no longer walk in the darkness of death.\nThen Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”\n-John 8:12 In addition to identifying himself as the “light of the world,” in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus also taught his disciples that they are the “light of the world,” meant to “shine” the light of his way of life so that people in the world do not have to walk toward the darkness of death.\nYou all are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bucket, but on a lampstand; so it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before humans, so that they may see your good actions and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\n-Matthew 6:14-16 By teaching that humans who are faithful to God will shine spiritual light to indicate how other humans should live, Jesus seems to be referring to an Old Testament prophecy from the Prophet Daniel.\nMany of those who sleep (i.e. are dead) in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt. Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the sky. Those who turn many toward right relationship will shine as the stars forever and ever.\n-Daniel 12:2-3 Hence, by praying, “Dear God, keep me shinin’,” Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is light. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about being a “light to the world” by being an example to those who are living in darkness and giving them an opportunity to turn toward right relationships with other humans. Rather than turning wicked people toward the light of life, Kendrick continues to express his desire to bring the darkness of death upon the hosts and attendees of the party.\nThe fuck do they really think?\nPocket-watching, you must be the police. Police “Pocket-watching, you must be the police” \u003e Police Kendrick’s prayer to God seems to be interrupted as he wonders what the “lame niggas\" are thinking about him. Kendrick seems to conclude that the “lame niggas” are thinking that he is acting like a police officer who is “pocket-watching” them.\n“Pocket-watching” refers to the act of closely monitoring what another person is doing—particularly regarding their use of money—so that the monitoring person can make some kind of judgment or assessment of the other person.\nWithin hip-hop culture, rappers, hustlers, and “street niggas” often describe an adversarial relationship with the police, most famously on the legendary rap group NWA’s hit single “Fuck tha Police.”\nBy saying that Kendrick “must be the police,” the “lame niggas” seem to be expressing some amount of nervousness that they might be caught, prosecuted, and judged for any illicit actions that they might have committed at “the party.”\nThe idea that Kendrick “must be the police” would also align with the battle track “meet the grahams,” where Kendrick claimed to be “policing” the “weird shit” going on in the entertainment industry after he dropped the bombshell allegation that Drake and his OVO crew have allegedly been sex trafficking underaged girls.\nSandra, sit down, what I’m about to say is heavy, now listen\nMm-mm, your son’s a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualizes ’em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein’ a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin’ his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin’ there’s predators like him lurkin’\nFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose\nI been in this industry twelve years, I’ma tell y’all one lil’ secret\nIt’s some weird shit goin’ on and some of these artists be here to police it*\nThey be streamlinin’ victims all inside of they home and callin’ ’em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas* God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think Bless “God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think” \u003e Bless After wondering what the “lame niggas” are** thinking about him, Kendrick goes back to praying to God. He now asks God to “bless” the words that he is rapping and the words that he is thinking.\nIn biblical terminology, a “blessing” refers to God giving preferential favor to people, places, objects, or things so that they may bring about more life and goodness on the earth.\nIn the very first narrative of the Bible, God gave a blessing to animals and then humans so that they would reproduce new life to fill the earth.\nGod created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”\nGod created humanity in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” -Genesis 1:21-23,27-28 However, when humans are tempted by the devil in the form of a snake and disobey God’s commandment by trying to define good and evil for themselves, their actions result in *a curse that leads to death and evil on the earth.\nThen the LORD God said to the snake,\n“Because you have done this,\nCursed are you more than all the livestock,\nAnd more than any animal of the field;\nOn your belly you shall go,\nAnd you shall eat dust\nAll the days of your life;\nThen the LORD God said to the human, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’:\nCursed is the ground because of you;\nWith hard labor you shall eat from it\nAll the days of your life.\nIt will grow both thorns and thistles for you;\nYet you shall eat the plants of the field;\nBy the sweat of your face\nYou shall eat bread,\nUntil you return to the ground,\nBecause from it you were taken;\nFor you are dust,\nAnd to dust you shall return.” -Genesis 3:14,17-19 The story of humanity receiving a blessing or a curse depending on whether they obey or disobey God’s commandments is a recurring biblical motif that gets further developed in the Book of Deuteronomy when the Prophet Moses gives a speech to the Israelites before they go into the “Promised Land” which God had prepared for them. Moses repeatedly told the Israelites that God was offering them a choice between life and death, between a blessing and a curse.\nIf you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I am commanding you today, that the Lord your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God: Blessed will you be in the city, and blessed will you be in the country.\nBlessed will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock.\nBlessed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\nBlessed will you be when you come in, and blessed will you be when you go out.\nBut it shall come about, if you do not obey the Lord your God, to be careful to follow all His commandments and His rules which I am commanding you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you.\nCursed will you be in the city, and cursed will you be in the country.\nCursed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\nCursed will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, the newborn of your herd, and the offspring of your flock.\nCursed will you be when you come in, and cursed will you be when you go out.\nThe LORD shall smite you with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.\nI have placed before you today life and good and also death and evil. For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his rules, and his justice, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you. I have placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed, to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days.\n-Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19,28 30:15-16,19-20 In the New Testament, Jesus and his chosen disciples commanded followers of Jesus love and bless their enemies and not to hate and curse them.\nJesus taught them saying, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n-Matthew 5:43-45 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.\n-St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans 12:14 Given that throughout the verses of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick has used his words to call for the execution of the hosts and attendees of “the party” and has been ignoring Jesus’s commandments to love his enemies and bless those who have persecuted him, it is ironic that Kendrick is now praying for God to “bless his words” and “bless how he think.”\nDAMN. “God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think” \u003e DAMN. It is notable that the title for Kendrick’s album, DAMN., is a shortening of the word “damnation,” which is a synonym for “curse” and the opposite of a “blessing.”\n“BLOOD.,” the first track on DAMN., opens with a voice that presents a choice between life and death, similar to the choice that the Prophet Moses placed in front of the Israelites.\nIs it wickedness?\nIs it weakness?\nYou decide.\nAre we gonna live or die? On “YAH.,” the third track on DAMN., Kendrick identifies himself as an Israelite and refers to a conversation in which his cousin Carl Duckworth told him that he was “cursed” based on Moses’s speech from Deuteronomy about blessings and curses.\nI’m a Israelite, don’t call me black no mo’\nThat word is only a color, it ain’t facts no mo’\nMy cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth\nSaid know my worth\nAnd Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed On “FEAR.,” the pivotal track on DAMN., we hear a voicemail in which Kendrick’s cousin Carl Duckworth quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and asserts that Kendrick is experiencing a cursed existence because he has not been following God’s commandments.\nWhat’s up, family?\nYeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man\nI know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately\nAnd I know you feel like, you know\nPeople ain’t been prayin’ for you\nBut you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people\nDeuteronomy 28:28 says,\n“The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart”\nSee, family, that’s why you feel like you feel\nLike you got a chip on your shoulder\nUntil you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\n…\nVerse 2 says,\n“You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,\ntherefore I will punish you for all your iniquities”\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He’s gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe’s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He’s gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that’s why we get chastised\nThat’s why we’re in the position that we’re in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me Drawing the line in the Old Testament “Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me” \u003e Drawing the line in the Old Testament Kendrick seems to be asking God to make a distinction between himself and the “lame niggas\" whom Kendrick wants God to keep away from him.\nKendrick seems to be requesting something similar to what God did when he rescued the Israelites from slavery.\nPrior to being rescued, the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptian Pharaoh, who forced the Israelites to live in slave houses in a region near the capital of Egypt. When Pharaoh worried that the Israelite population was becoming too large, he sent orders for soldiers to kill every baby boy born to an Israelite mother.\nGod saved one Israelite boy named Moses and later called Moses to be a prophet. God then sent Moses to confront Pharaoh by telling him to let the Israelites go free. When Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God used Moses to send ten different plagues, which brought death and destruction upon Egypt.\nAfter the first nine plagues, God said that he was going to send a final tenth plague in which a spirit of death would pass through the capital of Egypt and the neighboring regions. This spirit of death would kill the firstborn sons and male animals of every household as a punishment for Pharaoh and the Egyptians for killing the Israelites’ newborn sons.\nSince this plague of death was going to pass through the region of the Israelite slave houses, God told the Israelites that their sons and male animals would be spared if each Israelite household celebrated a Passover (aka Pesach / Pascha) ritual meal. During the Passover meal, each Israelite family would kill a lamb, smear the blood on the posts and crossbar of their exterior door, and eat the lamb meat with unleavened bread. When the spirit of death came across a door covered in lamb’s blood, it would “pass over” the house without killing the firstborn son or male animals.\nGod told Moses that by bringing death to the firstborn sons of Egypt while providing a way to preserve the lives of the sons of Israel, God was creating a line of separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites.\nThere will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. But against any of the children of Israel a dog won’t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, *that you may know that the LORD makes a line of separation between the Egyptians and Israel.\n-Exodus 11:6-7 Hence, by praying, “Dear God, draw the line” and prevent anyone from confusing Kendrick with the “lame niggas,” Kendrick seems to be asking God to kill the “lame niggas,\" similar to how God sent the spirit of death to kill the sons of the Egyptians who took the innocent lives of the Israelites in the Old Testament.\nDrawing the line in the New Testament “Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me” \u003e Drawing the line in the New Testament In the New Testament, there are several instances where Jesus speaks of a future day when he will separate the righteous from the wicked.\nIn St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about a landowner who instructs his servants to plant wheat seeds in a field. However, after the servants plant the wheat seeds, a deceptive adversary—who represents the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”]—comes at night to plant seeds that will grow into weeds that look like wheat but do not produce any grain (See Matthew 13:24-30,36-43).\nWhen the wheat and the weeds begin to sprout up, the servants discover that someone has planted weeds among the wheat. The servants initially want to pull out all the weeds from the field. However, the landowner stops them.\nThe landowner tells the servants that because the wheat and the weeds look very similar at this stage of their development, if the servants try to pull up the weeds, they may accidentally pull up some of the wheat as well. Moreover, since the wheat and the weeds are planted so close together, even if they can accurately distinguish between them, pulling up the weeds may uproot the wheat.\nThe landowner tells the servants that it is not yet time to pull up the weeds. Instead, the landowner tells the servants to wait until the time of the harvest when all of the wheat has had the chance to be fruitful and produce grain. At that point, the servants will be able to accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds. The servants will then gather the wheat together and burn up the weeds to dispose of them.\nJesus explains that this parable is a metaphor for the “Last Judgment” at the end of the world as we know it, when those who have lived lives in right relationships will be gathered together in God’s new creation, while the wicked are excluded from God’s new creation. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to be a kind of disobedient servant who refuses to listen to the landowner’s instructions and is convinced that now is the time to pull out the weeds. If he continues to disobey the landowner’s instructions, Kendrick may end up destroying the lives of those who will eventually produce good grain.\nIt is particularly ironic that in the first verse, Kendrick described himself as “the man that resides in patience,” but by saying, “I think it’s time to watch the party die,” Kendrick seems to be too impatient to wait for the time that the Lord has set to bring an end to wickedness.\nLater in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells another parable about the “Last Judgment,” in which the Lord will be like a herder who takes a mixed herd of sheep and goats into the pastures. However, at the end of the day, the herder separates the sheep from the goats and places the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.\nJesus explains that the sheep represent people who have maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need. In contrast, the goats represent people who have not maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need.\nIn the parable, many of the people who turn out to be sheep are not aware that they did anything in their lives that would cause them to be included among the sheep. Similarly, many of the people who turn out to be goats are not aware that they failed to do things that would have allowed them to be included among the sheep.\nThe fact that the identity of the sheep and the goats is a surprise that is not revealed until the end of time suggests that all humans should not be quick to assume that someone else is a goat or assume that they themselves are sheep. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to be convinced that he is one of the sheep. However, by advocating for burning down entire villages and ignoring Jesus’s commandments to love his neighbor, Kendrick is acting more like a goat who has failed to maintain right relationships.\nDear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried Forgiveness in the New Testament “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness in the New Testament Kendrick’s final request is for God to grant him forgiveness. In case God might not be inclined to forgive him, Kendrick tries to justify himself by pointing out how hard he has tried to do what’s right.\nThe request for God’s forgiveness echoes the Lord’s Prayer, which includes the following request:\nForgive us our transgressions (i.e. violations of trust)\nas we forgive those who transgress against us (i.e. violate our trust) After teaching his disciples the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus specifically highlighted the request for forgiveness by making it clear that God would not forgive those who refuse to forgive others.\nIf you forgive humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], your Father will also not forgive your [transgressions / violations of trust].\n-Matthew 6:14-15 Later on in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, one of Jesus’s disciples asked how many times he should forgive a brother who has done something wrong to him. In response, Jesus told his disciples a parable that reflected on the necessity for God’s people to forgive other humans because God has already forgiven his people to a much greater degree (See Matthew 18:21-35).\nIn this parable, there is a king—representing God the Father—who has many servants—representing different humans, particularly followers of Jesus.\nOne of these servants has somehow borrowed large amounts of money from the king and now owes the king what in today’s currency would be equivalent to $8 billion.\nWhen the king realizes how much money the servant owes him, the king announces plans to sell the servant into slavery along with the servant’s wife and children in order to at least recoup some money.\nThe servant then falls on the ground and begs the king not to sell him into slavery. He even tells the king that he will repay the equivalent of $8 billion that he owes.\nThe king has compassion on the servant, releases him from his impending slavery, and forgives all of the servant’s debts.\nHowever, immediately after having his debts forgiven, the first servant walks out of the king’s court and sees a second servant who owes the first servant what would be the equivalent of $14,000.\nThe first servant immediately grabs the second servant by the neck, begins choking him, and demands that the second servant pay him back.\nThe second servant then falls on the ground and begs the first servant to be patient, and he will repay the equivalent of $14,000 that he owes.\nHowever, the first servant refuses to forgive the second servant. Instead, the first servant throws the second servant into a debtor’s prison, where the second servant will be forced to work for three or more months in order to pay the first servant back.\nSoon, the king finds out what the first servant did to the second servant and calls the first servant back to his court. The king becomes angry with the first servant and strongly condemns him for refusing to forgive a $14,000 debt after the king had forgiven him a much, much larger $8 billion debt.\nThe king then once again holds the first servant responsible for the $8 billion debt. The king orders the first servant to be thrown into debtor’s prison until he has repaid the entire debt. This punishment is essentially a life sentence because it would take 164,000 years of labor for the first servant to pay the king back. Based on Jesus’s teaching on the Lord’s Prayer and the parable of the unforgiving servant, it is deeply ironic that Kendrick is praying, “Dear God, please forgive me,” after he has refused to forgive Drake or anyone who has participated in “the party” and has even claimed, “this shit done got too wicked to apologize.”\nMoreover, based on Jesus’s teaching, Kendrick’s self-justification that God knows “how hard I tried” seems destined to fall on deaf ears and be rejected by God. Jesus discussed how he would reject the pleas of individuals who claimed to do lots of things for God but refused to actually do what God the Father commands.\nJesus taught his disciple saying, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day,\n‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’\nAnd then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; leave Me, you who act against the law.’”\n-Matthew 7:21-23 Forgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge. The need for forgiveness has been a central theme within both DAMN. and Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.\nOn “DNA.”, the second track of DAMN., Kendrick rapped about the fact that his rough upbringing taught him so many things he needed to know to become successful in the world, but the one thing that he wished he had received was to be nurtured in a way that would allow him to forgive others.\nI know murder, conviction\nBurners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption\nScholars, fathers dead with kids and\nI wish I was fed forgiveness\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA The theme of monetary debts in the parable of the unforgiving servant also reminds us of the track “XXX.” from DAMN., where Kendrick tells a story about his friend’s son who was killed because of “insufficient funds.” When the friend called Kendrick and asked for spiritual guidance from an anointed Christian, Kendrick ignored Jesus’s teachings by saying that he would never forgive someone who harmed any one of his family members and that the friend should not forgive either.\nYesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101\nSaid they killed his only son because of insufficient funds\n…\nHe said, “K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me\nI know that you anointed, show me how to overcome”\nHe was lookin’ for some closure, hopin’ I could bring him closer\nTo the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him\n“I can’t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\n…\nLet somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman\nTouch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother\nYou should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap In the first verse of “Mother I Sober” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick acknowledged his battles with sex addiction, infidelity, and violations of trust in his relationships with Whitney, his fiancée, and the mother of his children. As he reckoned with the pain that he had caused to an innocent soul, Kendrick asked God whether he could be forgiven for what he had done.\nIntoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy The theme of forgiveness has noticeably been absent from the diss tracks that Kendrick released during his battle with Drake. Here in “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick seems to fully reject the idea of forgiving anyone even as he prays for God to forgive him.\nForgiveness and punishment “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness and punishment I do think it is important to point out that within the context of the Bible, forgiveness does not mean that society, law enforcement, or victims should allow a crime to go unpunished or—even worse—allow a perpetrator to continue harming the victim or other future victims.\nThis point is actually illustrated quite clearly by the Old Testament story of King David using his power to traffic a woman to his palace, force her to have sex with him, and then kill her husband to cover up a pregnancy. In that case, God sent a prophet to directly confront David about his evil and unjust actions. David admitted to being guilty under God’s judgment, repented, was forgiven by God, and was spared from the death penalty. However, David’s actions had real-world consequences that led to the deaths of at least three of David’s sons as well as a significant amount of societal shame. Over time, this shame made countless men in David’s time—along with later readers of the Bible—think twice about allowing uncontrolled sexual desire to lead them to coercing women or murdering people to cover up earlier acts of wickedness.\nOne can also look at the New Testament story from St. John’s account of the Gospel, in which a woman was caught while she was having sex in an adulterous relationship. Unlike the case of the woman with King David, she had apparently chosen to engage in this sexual relationship. She was then brought before an all-male court of Judean religious leaders who appealed to Jesus to serve as a trial judge to sentence her to death under the rules laid out in the laws given to Moses (See John 8:1-11).\nJesus sent all the accusers away by pointing out that they themselves had done things against the law of Moses that the Israelites were supposed to follow and thus should not feel that it was their right to condemn the woman to the death penalty.\nJesus had not done any actions that broke the law of Moses, so he theoretically had the right to condemn the woman to the death penalty. However, he chose not to. Instead, Jesus told the woman, “I do not condemn you. Go on your way. From now on, do not sin anymore.”\nIn this case, Jesus let the woman go free without any additional punishment beyond the societal shame that she had already experienced and would likely continue to experience. Jesus did not completely remove this consequence, though he did mitigate it to some degree by pointing out the lawless actions of her accusers.\nMoreover, Jesus warned her by saying, “Do not sin anymore.” This statement echoes a previous statement from Jesus after he healed a man and told him, “Now you have become well. Do not sin anymore, or something worse will happen to you.”\nHence, Jesus’s ultimate goal was for the woman not to be immediately killed for her wickedness but for her to find healing and be transformed so that she would be able to stop herself from acting in a way that would ruin her relationships and result in a negative final judgment at the end of time. I think it's time for me to watch the party die\nGet 'em gone, we gon' watch the party die\nSend ’em home, we gon’ watch the party die Die “I think it’s time…Get ’em gone…Send ’em home” \u003e Watch the party die After praying to God throughout most of the chorus, Kendrick ends the chorus by doubling down on the first line of the first verse. Kendrick further emphasizes his desire to execute the hosts and attendees of the party by saying “watch the party die” three times and adding the phrases “send ’em home” and “get ’em gone,” which are both slang phrases for killing someone. [Verse 2] I think it’s time to watch the party die Repeated “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Repeated Kendrick begins the second verse with the same line from beginning of the first verse. Additionally, the chorus ended with Kendrick saying “watch the party die” three times. By continuing to repeat this phrase, Kendrick seems to be speaking like someone with an unhealthy obsession with vigilante justice. Street niggas and the corporate guys,\nthe rappers that report the lies Street niggas “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Street niggas Kendrick seems to be highlighting more people who should be executed for the benefit of society.\n“Street niggas\" refer to young Black men who are engaged in selling drugs, hustling, robberies, gang banging or any other kind of illegal activity that is done to get money. These kinds of activities are statistically more common in densely populated, urbanized neighborhoods in major American cities where people are more likely to walk through the city on street sidewalks in contrast to American suburbs where many people exclusively drive from one place to another.\nThe illegal activities in which “street niggas” often engage often lead to violence, murder and other casualties as Kendrick has detailed throughout much of his work, such as the track “Poe Man’s Dreams” from Section.80.\nMy mama is stressin’, my daddy tired\nI need me a weapon, these niggas ride\nEvery minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me\nHow I’m gon’ listen when I don’t even hear God?\nHeaven or hell, base it all on my instincts\nMy hands dirty, you worried ‘bout mud in your sink\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with you’ll squeal with you Since “street niggas\" typically depict themselves as people who like to kill others, they would likely be included among the peaople who Kendrick planned to execute when he said “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives.”\nCorporate guys “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Corporate guys “Corporate guys” likely refers to the entertainment industry’s corporate employees who are paid to find ways of making money from music, films and other forms of entertainment. In many cases, their approach to making money is not in the best interest of the artist who makes the work, the audience who consumes the work, or the society in which the work is distibuted.\nIn the case that “corporate guys” are trying to make money from the stories of “street niggas”, the resulting work may actually lead the audience to immitate behavior that leads some individuals to kill other individuals.\nWithin both DAMN. and Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick has pointed out that corporate employees often hide their tendency to be killers and murderers while teaching their own deceptive philosophies to the youth.\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts\n-“XXX.”\nThe world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run\nThe prophets abandoned, the law take advantage,\nthe market is crashin’, the industry wants\nNiggas and bitches to sleep in a box\nwhile they makin’ a mockery followin’ us\nThis ain’t Monopoly, watchin’ for love.\nThis ain’t monogamy. Y’all gettin’ fucked*\n-“N95”\n*I’m a killer, he’s a killer, she’s a killer, bitch\nWe some killers, walkin’ zombies, tryna scratch that itch\n…\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology\nSilent murderer, what’s your body count? Who your sponsorship?\n-“Worldwide Steppers” “Corporate guys” may thus be complicit with those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” and for whom “the graveyard is company”.\nRappers that report the lies “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Rappers that report the lies Rather than “givin’ truth to the youth”, “corporate guys” often appropriate the stories from “street niggas” and package them in music made by “rappers that report the lies”.\nOn “N95.” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick seemed to expose liars in the rap game and demand that they take off their lies like an actor taking off a mask.\nYou’re back outside, but they still lied\n…\nTake off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi\nTake off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies\nTake off the weird-ass jewelry, I’ma take ten steps, then I’m taking off top five\nTake off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it’s a real world outside\n(Take that shit off) It’s also notable that in the battle tracks, Kendrick repeatedly called Drake a liar, actor, and manipulator who has tried to borrow stories and credibility from “street niggas”.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now is spiralin’\nYou’re movin’ just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin’ distasteful\nI calculate you’re not as calculated, I can even predict your angle\nFabricatin’ stories on the family front ‘cause you heard Mr. Morale\nA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now\nYou’re not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\n…\nKnow you a master manipulator and habitual liar too\nBut don’t tell no lie about me and I won’t tell truths ‘bout you\n…\nHow many more fairytale stories ‘bout your life ’til we had enough?\nHow many more Black features ’til you finally feel that you’re Black enough?\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n…\nI’m allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein’ famous\nYachty can’t give you no swag neither,\nI don’t give a fuck ‘bout who you hang with\n-“euphoria”\nI think somebody lying\nSmell somebody lying\nI don’t see no fire\n…\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I can see the vibes on Ak’\nEven he lookin’ compromised, let’s peel the layers back\n-“6:16 in LA”\nYou a body shamer, you gon’ hide them baby mamas, ain’t ya?\nYou embarrassed of ’em, that’s not right, that ain’t how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself\n-“meet the grahams”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 god, ayy\n…\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\n-“Not Like Us” Kendrick expressed his hatred for all street niggas, corporate guys, rappers and members of the entertainment industry who have empowered, emboldened and enabled Drake.\nWhoever that’s fuckin’ with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too I need they families mortified Families moritifed “I need they families mortified” \u003e Families mortified In addition to ordering the execution of the “street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies”, Kendrick says that he “needs” the families of these individuals to be “mortified”. The word “mortified” refers to someone feeling ashamed, particularly when they are in the view of the public.\nIt is notable that in early forms of English—from the 1300s to the 1700s—the word “moritiy” meant “to kill”. The word was originally derived from the Latin word “mortificō” which literally meant “to put to death”. In early forms of English, “mortify” was often used metaphorically to refer to the act of subduing, humbling, or humiliating someone.\nBy using the word mortify, Kendrick subtly brings up the idea that the family of the street niggas, corporate guys, and lying rappers should also be killed. The idea of killing family members of excessively wicked individuals connects back to first verse where Kendrick told his supporters to “burn the whole village”. We can do life without 'em. Get they bodies organized.\nTell me if you obliged Life goes on without them “We can do life without ’em. Get they bodies organized.” \u003e Execution orders Coming after the previous lines, Kendrick again seems to be assuring his supporters that it is okay to kill the street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies\"along with their family members because society will go on just fine without them being alive.\nKendrick then seems to appeal to his supporters to join his roster of executioners and help in the process of organizing the dead bodies after carrying out the execution orders. No more pillow-talkin', jump-startin' neighborhood wars\nDirty-mackin’ bitches because your spirit is insecure Pillow-talking “No more pillow-talkin’, jump-startin’ neighborhood wars” \u003e Pillow-talking “Pillow-talking” refers to conversations that happen between couples while lying down in bed with their heads on pillows after having sex.\nCertain hip hop media figures, such as DJ Akademics, have explained that arguments, hatred and information that is leveraged within rap battle often spreads because many rappers will often have sex with the same set of women. These women end up pillow-talking about the other rappers with whom they have had sex.\nDJ Akademics—who is sometimes referred to as Ak’—is also known for being a loyal supporter of Drake. Kendrick previously suggested that DJ Akademics is compromised on “6:16 in LA”.\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I can see the vibes on Ak’\nEven he lookin’ compromised, let’s peel the layers back The pillow-talking dynamic also exist among violent street niggas, which explains how pillow-talking could lead to neighborhood wars.\nBy saying “no more pillow-talkin’”, Kendrick seems to be implying that he will be giving orders to execute the “dirty-macking bitches” who have attended “the party” or had sex with the street niggas, corporate guys or rappers that report the lies.\nDirty-mackin’ bitches “Dirty-mackin’ bitches because your spirit is insecure” \u003e Dirty-mackin’ bitches “Macking” refers to physical contact, conversations, or other flirtatious actions that a person does to flirt or attract someone with whom the person wants to have sex.\nDirty can be used to describe something that is dishonorable or something that is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.\nHere Kendrick seems to be criticizing the “dirty ackin’” women and men whose “pillow-talking” is leading to neighborhood wars.\nKendrick seems to suggest the reason why men or women get into these “dirty-macking”, “pillow-talking” sexual relationships because they are insecure men who need the validation of an attractive woman agreeing to have sex with them or insecure women who need the validation of a famous rapper expressing a strong desire to have sex with them. The flashy nigga with nasty decisions\nusin’ money as a backbone Nasty “The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin’ money as a backbone” \u003e Nasty In slang, “flashy” is an adjective which describes someone who shows off or flaunts their wealth and possession. “Flashy niggas” might thus be included among those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”.\nThe idea of “dirty” from the previous line gets escalated to “nasty”, conveys a sense of repulsion or aversion. Both “dirty” and “nasty” are used as slang adjectives to describe someone who is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.\nThe words “nasty” and “dirty” are both synonyms for the word “freaky” which Kendrick used when he described Drake as a “freaky ass nigga” and a “69 god”—in reference to an adventurous form of simultaneous oral sex-on “Not Like Us.”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 god, ayy\nFreaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy\n…\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life Backbone “The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin’ money as a backbone” \u003e Backbone In English “having a backbone” is an idiom for having the courage, strength, and ability to stand up for oneself.\nKendrick’s criticism of “the flashy nigga” who is “usin’ money as a backbone” may also be applied to Drake. Within the battle, Kendrick accused Drake of acting like a tough “street nigga” even though he has no backbone and has to pass real street niggas to join his crew an be his “backbone”. However, as Kendrick pointed out, these “street niggas” who are paid to be Drake’s “backbone” are actually a liability because they are not truly loyal to Drake and are only around for the money.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now is spiralin’\n…\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n-“euphoria”.\nHave you ever thought that OVO is workin’ for me?\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\n…\nIt was fun until you started to put money in the streets\nThen lost money ‘cause they came back with no receipts\n…\nIf you were street-smart, then you woulda caught\nthat your entourage is only to hustle you\nA hundred niggas that you got on salary\nAnd twenty of ’em want you as a casualty\nAnd one of them is actually next to you\nAnd two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle\nJust don’t got the audacity to tell you\n-“6:16 in LA” Drake’s strategy of paying “street niggas” and other tough guys to be part of his crew is well documented online most notably in this video by HipHopMadness.\nI want his head cracked before he’s back home Head cracked “I want his head cracked before he’s back home” \u003e Head cracked Kendrick give even more specific instructions on how he wants the hosts and attendees of “the party” to be executed. In this case, he orders his executioners kill the condemned man by hitting him in the head with some kind of blunt weapon until the man’s skull is cracked open.\nKendrick orders for the execution to happen while the condemned man is out of his house and before the condemned man ever has a chance to come back home that day. The immediacy of these orders further highlights the idea that “it is time” to watch the party die.\nThe specificity of these execution orders resembles “XXX.” from DAMN. where Kendrick talked about how he would kill someone who had killed his son by waiting outside of the building where the killer was located and then gun the killer down at his first opportunity.\nI’d wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI’d catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI’d chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap*\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”* The radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary Propaganda “The radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary” \u003e Propaganda A “radio personality” is host of an radio program, podcast or other form of audio based content who publicly broadcasts his or her perspective on current events or popular culture. Propaganda is the deliberate dissemination of information, ideas, or messages that are often biased or misleading and are designed to influence public opinion, manipulate emotions, or promote a specific agenda or ideology. Propaganda is typically disseminated by powerful or influential political entity, government, industry or group who wants to influence the public in order to control their actions or hold on to power. Kendrick implies that many of these “radio personalities” are getting paid to use their platform to disseminate propaganda on behalf of the entertainment industry or on behalf of the systems which mentally enslave Black people.\nIt is notable that on his 2016 track, “Hype”, Drake boasts about creating his own propaganda.\nI don’t take this shit for granted\nI do my own propaganda On the battle track “6:16 in LA”, Kendrick accuses Drake of “playin’ dirty with propaganda”.\nBut let me tell you some game ‘cause I can see you, my lil’ homie\nYou playin’ dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya\nYou’re playin’ nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots\nBut your reality can’t hide behind Wi-Fi\nYour lil’ memes is losin’ steam, they figured you out\nThe forced opinions is not convincin’, y’all need a new route A few months after “Watch the Party Die” was released, Kendrick released the album GNX whose opening track “wacced out murals” mentions “Watch the Party Die” and specifically criticies a White comedy podcast host who controvertially joked about Black women being emotionally disregulated and violent.\nDon’t let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that’s law\nI know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that’s close to them\nThe niggas that coon, the niggas that bein’ groomed, slide on both of them On the track “Worldwide Steppers” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick asserted that Hollywood’s corporate leaders and employees are “silent murderers” who teach their deadly and deceptive philosophies in schools.\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology Let me know when they turn up as a casualty\nI want agony, assault, and battery Sadistic “…casualty. I want agony, assault, and battery” \u003e Sadistic In English the word “casualty” is used to refer to someone who has died—or in some cases someone who has been injured—during an act of violence such a war or a criminal attack.\nIn the most narrow legal definition, “assault” is a crime in which a someone causes reasonable fear that they will cause physical harm to another person or make unwanted physical contact with another person. Meanwhile, “battery” is a crime in which someone actually causes physical harm or makes unwanted physical contact.\nThe use of the terms “assault” and “battery” reminds us that the acts of all of these vigilante executions which Kendrick has ordered are illegal, criminal attacks.\nMoreover, by saying that he wants the hosts and attendees of “the party” to experience extreme physical and mental suffering or “agony”, Kendrick seems to not be satisfied with simply ridding society of wicked people. He seems to be expressing an unhealthy and sadistic enjoyment of knowing that wicked people will experience extreme suffering. I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people\nmakin’ humanity work New Earth in the New Testament “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Earth in the New Testament The term “New Earth” originates from, “The Revelation”, the final book in the New Testament and the Bible in which St. John sees a prophetic, visionary “Revelation” from Jesus.\nIn this prophetic vision, Jesus shows St. John how the oppression, persecution, violence and killings that Christians faced under various Roman Emperors from 64 to 100 AD are part of a much larger pattern of the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”] trying to bring death and destruction to those who follow Jesus as their Lord.\nJesus encourages various church communities to “overcome” not by starting a revolution or killing their oppressors, but by forgiving and loving the humans who are acting like enemies, but are really just under the control of the true enemy—the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].\nJesus encourages these persecuted church communities to trust that one day Jesus will defeat the true enemy. Moreover, Jesus promised that one day, God will bring an end to the world as it currently exists and bring about a “New Heaven” which fully overlaps with a “New Earth”. In this overlapping “New Heaven” and “New Earth” where all humans will know God, have a loving relationship with God, and obey God’s commandments, which will lead to an eternal life of peace, justice and right relationships.\nThis transformation from the current Earth to the “New Earth” is described in the second to last chapter of “The Revelation” where St. John describes the end of his vision by saying:\nI saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more. I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, God’s [tent / residence] is with humans, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; There will be no mourning, no crying, no pain, any more. The first things have passed away.”\n-Revelation 21:1-4 New Earth in New Age Spirituality “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Earth in New Age Spirituality More recently, biblical concept of a “New Earth” has also been encorporated into “New Age” spirituality.\n“New Age” spirituality is a somewhat fluid category of spiritual beliefs and practices that arose from the “hippie” and “counterculture” movement of the late 1960s. Teachers and practitioners of New Age spirituality blend Eastern spiritual traditions (e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism)\\ with some aspects of Western Christianity and a modern, secular humanist ethos.\nAfter the initial popularity of New Age spirituality in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of New Age ideas in the late late 1990s and early 2000s due to the populaity of self-help psychology books by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle’s is known best for his 1997 book The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment and his 2005 book A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose.\nIn 2008, the legendary Black talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, hosted Eckhart Tolle on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his book A New Earth. Oprah also added A New Earth to Oprah’s Book Club and hosted a 10-week live online class series where Eckhart Tolle discussed A New Earth chapter by chapter.\nSimilar fashion to other forms of New Age spirituality, A New Earth takes some ideas from the Bible, such as St. John’s vision of “a New Heaven and a New Earth” and subtly redefines it through the perspective of Eastern spiritual beliefs, practices, and terminology.\nIn particular, A New Earth builds on the concepts from Tolle’s previous book The Power of Now to focus on the Buddhist/Hindu idea that humans must go through an “ego death” so that their suffering will end and their individual identities (or the illusion of their individual identities) can melt away into a new, unified harmony with the universe. Within Tolle’s writing, this ego death is said to take place through practices such a Buddhist forms of emptying meditation that lead a person to awaken into a greater state of awareness or “consciousness” in moment or in the “now”. New Testament and New Age in Kendrick’s work “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Testament and New Age in Kendrick’s work While the influence of Christianity has already been well documented throughout this analysis, it should also be noted that Eckhart Tolle has clearly had a significant influence on Kendrick’s work beginning at least as early as 2021 when Kendrick released a video introducing his new media production company, pgLang. This introductory video contains imagery of meditative practices, a clock in which every hour is labeled as “now”, a scene were a young woman chooses “NOW” instead of “PAST” or “FUTURE”, and a scene were Kendrick sits across from Eckhart Tolle and listens intently as Tolle gives spiritual/psychologial guidance.\nOn Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Eckhart Tolle is introduced as Kendrick’s psychotherapist and a major contributor to the album.\nKodak Black, Oklama\nEckhart Tolle\nAnd this here is the big stepper\n-“Worldwide Stepper”\nWhitney: You really need some therapy.\nKendrick: Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin’ about?\nWhitney: Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck.\nKendrick: Shit, everybody stupid.\nWhitney: Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody. Reach out to Eckhart.\n-“Father Time” Eckhart Tolle’s voice is heard on several occasions on the second half of Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers.\nMr. Duckworth…\n-“Count Me Out”\nIf you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let’s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you…\n-“Savior (Interlude)”\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n-“Auntie Diaries”\nPeople get taken over by this pain-body, because this energy field that almost has a life of its own—it needs to periodically feed on more unhappiness.\n-“Mr. Morale” On the last verse of “Rich Spirit”, ends with Kendrick specifically referencing the “New Earth” after making references to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and other New Age concepts earlier in an the track.\nTakin’ my baby to school, then I pray for her\n‘Cause you bitches ain’t never been cool, writin’ testament\nPaintin’ pictures, put me in the Louvre, that’s a definite\nUniversal shift, I’m in a groove\n…\nThe aloof Buddha, I’m Christ with a shooter\nPraise to Muhammad, I might nigga noose ya\n…\nSpirit medium, I don’t rap, brother\n…\nI’m fasting four days out the week, brother\n…\nThe New Earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives Whether Kendrick is currently seeing a vision of the traditional Christian understanding of a “New Earth” or the New Age version, the reference to a peaceful “New Earth” is in sharp contrast to the increasingly violent rhetoric that Kendrick is using throughout the verse.\nKendrick seems to be implying that the end goal of a “New Earth” justifies the means of violent and inhumane vigilante executions. This “ends-justify-the-means” logic twists the prophetic vision of a “New Earth” into dystopian, totalitarian vision of a bloody revolution and political purge.\nLet’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies Mollies “Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies” \u003e Mollies After ordering the executions of social media influencers on the previous verse, Kendrick is now adding the followers of those influencers to the execution list.\nIn particular he calls out the follower who are “poppin mollies”. “Molly” is slang for the pure, molecular—from which we get the name molly—form of psychoactive drug MDMA. This pure form of MDMA is distinguished from the drug ecstasy in which MDMA is mixed with other substances.\nMDMA increases heart rate, makes users feel more energetic, induces increased emotional and sensory experience, increases feelings of connection and empathy and overall leads to feelings of euphoria. However, these positive feelings can lead to an emotional crash and increased anxiety after the effects of the drug wears off.\nMDMA was originally used in the 1970s to assist with psychotherapy for conditions such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, by the 1980s forms of MDMA and eventually molly began to be used as a “party drug” at raves, electronic music concerts and other dance parties. Molly’s status as a “party drug” connects to the recurring motif of “the party” throughout “Watch the Party Die”.\nMolly has also been referenced in the lyrics of a countless number of songs by “rappers that report the lies” and “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”.\nIt seems that Kendrick now wants to execute the followers who have been using mollie in order to prevent the usage of the drug from spreading to other innocent lives and negatively affective society. from the obvious degenerates Degenerates “from the obvious degenerates” \u003e Degenerates The “followers” who are “poppin mollie” seems to be following the influence of people who Kendrick describes as “degenerates”. The word “degenerate” refers morally corrupt people or more generally to people who have lost desirable physical, mental or social characteristics.\nLabeling a certain group of people with a term like “degenerates” has historicaly been a propaganda strategy for totalitarian rulers to justify eliminating certain cultural influences or killing off certain group of people. Most notably, in the Nazi Party in Germany began to describe modern art with the term “Entartete Kunst” meaning “Degenerate Art”. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany because such art was deemed “an insult to German feeling”. The Nazi party also ran a propaganda campaign against “Degenerate Music” which specifically targeted jazz music due to its “Negroid excesses in tempo” and “Jewishly gloomy lyrics.”\nGiven that Nazi propaganda would have labeled Kendrick’s own form of hip hop music as “Degenerate Music”, it is ironic that Kendrick is not labeling other media influencers as degenerates and executing them alongside “the radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary”. that’s failing to acknowledge the hope that we tryna spread Hope “that’s failing to acknowledge the hope that we tryna spread” \u003e Hope Kendrick again seems to be highlighting the hope of a “New Earth” that can be created after all of the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party” are elimiated from society.\nKendrick seems to be implying that the “degenerates” among the media influencers are spreading cynical criticism of Kendrick’s message of hope. This assessement is conistent with the lines from the first verse where Kendrick said:\nInfluencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit\nBut they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent Because these influencers have been talking down at Kendrick and failing to talk positively about the hope that Kendrick and his supporters are trying to spread through Kendrick’s music, Kendrick has included these influencers among those who will be viciously executed.\nIf I'm not his vote then you need to bring his fuckin' head\nor film that shit in hi-res Vote “If I’m not his vote then you need to bring his fuckin’ head” \u003e Vote Kendrick’s campaign of totalitarian executions seems to be taking place that is a nominal democracy. Elections are still being held and Kendrick could theoretically be voted out of power. However, if anyone tries to oppose him by running an effective opposition campain or even casting a vote for the opposition, Kendrick wants such a person to be beheaded.\nThis kind of election where voters are not free to cast their vote without suffering retribution for voting against the ruling party is often referred to as a “sham election”.\nMonths before the release of “Watch the Party Die” in March of 2024, the United States and other Western European allies denounced Russia’s presidential election as a “sham election” after Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President of Russia with 88% of vote, which happed to be the highest percentage vote in the history of Russian democracy.\nVladimir Putin’s re-election follows more than a decade in which political opposition leaders have been harrassed, silenced, imprisoned and assasinated. The most recent casualty was Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian prison under suspicious circumstances in February of 2024, just a month before the election.\nOn the track “Savior” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick specifially highlighted Vladimir Putin as an example of oppresive leadership after he invaded Ukraine in Febrary of 2022 after claiming that Ukraine was governed by a neo-Nazi regime.\nVladimir making nightmares\nBut that’s how we all think\nThe collective conscious\nCalamities on repeat While Kendrick did highlight Vladimir Putin’s destructive behavior on “Savior”, Kendrick overall point seemed to be that Vladimir Putin is not unique or even outside of the norm. Instead, Kendrick asserted that Vladimir Putin’s behavior simply reveals the way that all of us natrually think. Here on “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick proudly expresses this collective way thought as he seeks to eliminate anyone who does not support his vigilante campaign.\nBring his head “you need to bring his fuckin’ head or film that shit in hi-res” \u003e Bring his head Kendrick again exhibits sadistic tendencies as he demands to see the decapitated head of the person who did not vote for Kendrick. The executioners must either bring the decapitated head to Kendrick to see or they must film the decapitation in a high resolution video format so that Kendrick can see all of the small details when he watches the recording.\nIt is also notable that the Gospel accounts of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke all tell the story about a wicked queen who conspires to have the king order the beheading of a John, the great prophet who baptized Jesus. Moreover, she got the king to bring John’s head to her on a dinner platter.\nJohn the Baptist was Jesus’s cousin and was highly respected prophet who called the Israelites to “repent” (i.e. change their way of thinking) and be baptized. John also spoke out against the unjust actions of powerful figures including Herod, the puppet king of a Roman-controlled, Israelite region called Galilee.\nJohn the Baptist publicly criticized King Herod, telling him that it was not right or just for him to take his own brother’s wife, Herodias, so that he could marry her for himself.\nThe new queen, Herodias, became very angry at St. John the Baptist and got King Herod to arrest John. Still the queen was not satisfied with just arresting St. John. She wanted him to be killed even though the king was very reluctant to do so. Queen Herodias then looked for a way to kill the prophet John, much like Queen Jezebel looked for a way to kill the prophet Elijah.\nThen when King Herod threw a birthday party for himself, the queen sent her daughter to dance for Herodias and his guests at the party. The queen’s daughter’s dancing was apparently so stimulating and pleasurable for King Herod that without thinking he made an oath in front of all his guests that he would give the queen’s daughter whatever she wanted.\nThe daughter consulted with her mother, who immediately told her to ask the king to bring her the head of John the Baptist on a dinner platter. The king was sad and upset with himself because he really didn’t want to kill John, but because he had made the oath in front of his guests and was too proud to look dishonorable by going back on his word, he agreed. He immediately ordered soldiers to decapitate John the Baptist and bring the head on a platter to the daughter who then presented it to the queen.\nThe fact that John the Baptist was decapitated due to a party where a younger girl danced in a sensual way to gratify a group of powerful men brings us back to the motif of “the party” and the alleged trafficing of underage girls for sex parties at Drake’s mansion.\nAt the same time, by demanding for his executionors to bring him a the head of the man who refused to vote for him, Kendrick, the King of LA, is now playing the role of King Herod and Queen Herodias who unjustly killed the prophet, John the Baptist. [Verse 3] Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do? Lecrae “Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do” \u003e Lecrae Here for the first time in “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick seems to reconsider whether he is doing the right thing by executing the hosts and attendees of “the party”.\nIn particular Kendrick wonders whether Lecrae, a famous Christian rapper, would pray for the hosts and attendees of the party or “fuck these niggas up” by violently assaulting them.\nLecrae happens to be the most famous and successful artist in the history of the Christian hip hop (aka CHH). Christian hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that utilizes similar production, rapping and singing styles as mainstream hip hop. However, unlike mainstream hip hop, Christian hip hip is committed to presenting lyrics that help people understand and identify with Christian values, beliefs, and behavior.\nBecause of the necessary commitment to Christian values, beliefs and behavior, artists that are accepted as part of Christian hip hop will not make songs that glorify scamming, gluttony, sexual promiscuity or criminal activity. In fact it is very rare for Christian hip hip artists to release music with any words that would be considered explicit: including profanity, sexual terminology or racial slurs.\nDespite the high moral and behavioral expectations that come with being a Christian hip hop artis, Lecrae had a rough upbriging that was similar to many mainstream hip hop artists.\nLecrae never met his father and was raised by a single mother in a low income, urban, Black neighborhood. He was not raised as a Christian but became a very committed Christian later in life. That background has allowed Lecrae to speak to the reality of “street life” while also being able to clearly articulate Jesus’s teaching in language that is accessible to urban, Black audiences.\nSimilar to Kendrick on To Pimp a Butterfly, DAMN. and Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Lecrae has also publicly wrestled with his faith in God, hypocrisy among Christian leaders including himself, depression, personal struggles with addiction, and the weight of serving as a leader in a Black community facing various social issues.\nLast year I was feeling hopeless\nI just wanted it to end\nPeople stealing money from me, man\nI swear I thought that we was friends\nAnd I was so depressed, I was such a mess\nI couldn’t shake it off\nAnother murder on the television\nMan, somebody go turn it off\nI spoke my mind, I got attacked for it\nThought these people had my back boy\nThen they tellin’ me I asked for it\nI guess I’m just another black boy\nAnd then they killed Tamir Rice\nAnd they just go on with they life\nThey tellin’ me shut up talking ‘bout it\nLike, I should just talk about Christ\nBut the truth is I started to doubt God\nI started to question my purpose\nI started to act out\nI ain’t wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile\nDoctors told me that my man died\nI almost had a breakdown So tell depression it can fly away\nTell my doubts that they can die today\nI’ma catch me a wave, sail away\nCan’t stop me now\n-“Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)”\nI would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such\nYou know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch\nI was so involved, never thought that I could fall, y’all\nRight before the fall of 2015, I was all off\nIt involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down\nTweeted ‘bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground\nAnd Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times\nThis time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized\nDoubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame\n“Shame on you, ‘Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus’ name”\nCut me deep, I was losing sleep, “God, ain’t these Your sheep?”\nWhy they hate me like they do? Maybe grace is really cheap\nMaybe this is all a lie, they don’t really love me\nThey just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public\nThey’re like following they God mean turnin’ on Black people\nIs Black evil? Why do they hate and attack people?\nI’m vulnerable and cautious, I’m reading Baldwin\nTa-Nehisi got me thinking, now I’m going all in\nI ain’t know if God was real no mo’\nEvery day we gettin’ killed and I can’t deal no mo’\nI started slipping in the darkness, I’m feeling heartless\nChristians got me traumatized, I don’t know who God is\nDrinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree\nMaybe I should get divorced, I don’t know why she married me\nWhat’s the purpose? What’s the point?\nNothing matters, I’m just matter, I’m just atoms\nAin’t no Eve and ain’t no Adam\nWhere the Xannies? Let me at ’em\nI was floating in confusion until I dropped\nWoke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped -“Deconstruction” Given his background and spiritual perspective, Lecrae seems to be the perfect person to provide Kendrick with a perspective on whether Kendrick should rely on prayer or use violence to improve society.\nIt is also notable that prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Lecrae released a podcast episode in which he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake.\nIn the podcast episode, Lecrae accepted that rap battles as an established part of hip hop culture. Since Lecrae grew up with hip hop culture, he was reluctant to criticize rap battles in and of themselves.\nLecrae also acknowledged that Kendrick was providing Drake with some feedback that he probably needed to hear.\nWe all need friends like Kendrick who are willing to tell us about ourselves. I never want to have to run into somebody in a rap battle to tell me the truth about myself.\nHowever, Lecrae did express his concern that the way that Kendrick and Drake approached the rap battle (and to some extent how most rappers approach rap battles) demonstrates an unhealthy attempt to build their own sense of value and self-worth based on their ability to beat down another person.\nPrayer ““Fuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?” \u003e Prayer Prayer was a major motif within DAMN.. Throughout that album, Kendrick repeatedly lamented that fact that no one was praying for him. However, at a pivotal point of the album, Kendrick’s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail telling Kendrick that the cursed existence that he was experiencing was not due to a lack of people praying for Kendrick but due to a lack of Kendrick following God’s commandments.\nNew Kung Fu Kenny\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\n…\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n-“ELEMENT.”\nShit I feel like\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’\n…\nI feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me? -“FEEL.”\nNobody pray for me\nIt been that day for me\n-“HUMBLE.”\nWhat’s up, family? Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately and I know you feel like, you know people ain’t been prayin’ for you but you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, “The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness, and astonishment of heart.” See, family, that’s why you feel like you feel, like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\nVerse 2 says, “You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities”. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse, because He said He’s gonna punish us. The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel - He’s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods. “That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee.” So, just like you chasten your own son, He’s gonna chasten you, because He loves you. So that’s why we get chastised. That’s why we’re in the position that we’re in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us. We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live, here, in today, in the United States of America. I love you, family, and I pray for you. God bless you. Shalom.\n-“FEAR.” DAMN. thus conveys the idea that prayer is insufficient if individual do not change the way that they live and begin to follow God’s commandments. This idea about the need to follow God’s commandments and help other to follow God’s commandments might thus present a third way as opposed to exclusively praying or exclusively “fucking these niggas up.”\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1 Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry Dee-1 is another Christian hip hop artist whose career has run in paralle to Lecrae’s. Dee-1’s first mixtape was released in 2004, the same year that Lecrae released his first album. However, Dee-1 has not come close to acheiving the level success or influence that Lecrae has had throughout his career.\nPart of this gap in success could be attributed to skill level and artistic choices. However, from Dee-1’s perspective a big part of the gap in success is due to the fact that Dee-1 has been uncompromising in his commitment to deliver music with a clear Christian message and a willingness to call out issues in hip hop culture and the music industry that he sees as being misaligned with Jesus’s teaching.\nWith a timing and perspective that runs almost parallel to Katt Williams, Dee-1 gave given an interview in January of 2024 where he discussed how he has been denied opportunities from entertainment industry “gatekeepers” because he wouldn’t compromize his own integrity. Most notably, Dee-1 talked about haveing to say “no” to powerful men in the entertainment industry who tried to coerce him into performing oral sex or receiving anal sex in order to receive a record deal.\nThere’s gatekeepers. So if you’re trying to get signed to a major label, there’s gatekeepers. If you’re trying to get on certain media platforms to get interviewed, there’s gatekeepers. If you trying to get on the mainstream radio, urban radio, there’s gatekeepers. Yes. Yes. Yes.\nI will say one last thing about gatekeepers—the only true gatekeeper to what’s meant for you in this world is God and your level of integrity. That’s the only two gatekeepers, because what’s meant for you and what you want that’s two different things and a lot of times people end up wanting things that ain’t of God. Now if you want something that ain’t of God, you got to go through gatekeepers…, who really ain’t nobody in in the big scheme of things on the totem pole of people with integrity and people with morals values and principles. These gatekeepers ain’t nobody, but in this perverted sick twisted industry these gatekeepers do hold access to certain levels, you know.\nBro, I’ve had gatekeepers in the music industry who have literally tried to hold a record deal behind their back and let me know like, “Look,if you a part of this homosexual act that I’m trying to take part in, this door open real quick fory you.” I got a song where I’ve talked about that before called “The Devil’s Playground.” This is real dog and the only way that that type of stuff can work on you is if you let them have all the leverage to where you want what’s behind that gate that bad. So that’s that’s a real thing.\nYou also got people—this a different type of gatekeeper—the gatekeepers who will say, “Hey you making too much righteous noise right now. If you just tone that righteousness down a little bit then we’ll allow you into these doors, but you got to tone that down. You got to becomea little more vanilla, a little more lukewarm, a little more bland and you’ll fit in with us. That’s the slick gatekeeping. It ain’t telling you to all the way, you know, bend over or or open your mouth or something like that. It ain’t that, but it’s telling you like dim your light. And what ends up happening is you got so many people that’s like, “Well that’s not that bad. They not asking me to do nothing super crazy I just got to dim my light.” That’s the scariest kind right there ‘cause a lot of people will be like, “Wait I just got to turn it from level 10 to level 5? Man, bet. I could do that. Bro, all right, bet. Now I get accepted. Cool.” Next thing, you know you got a whole industry that’s lukewarm—whole industry lukewarm, so that when somebody that’s on fire come along they looking at it like, “Whoa, you crazy! Hold on. You shining too bright. Hold on. Hold on. Chill out, man. You doing the most. You messing up, man. Stop man.” As mentioned in that interview, back in 2017, Dee-1 released a track called “The Devil’s Playground” in which he mentioned having to say no to powerful man in music industry who offered to manage Dee-1 if Dee-1 would have sex with him. Dee-1 highlighted this experience as an example of how the entire music industry is under the control of Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”).\nLucifer laughs when he listens to the radio\nEnjoyin’ all the hate blastin’ through the stereo\nHis plan worked, our music gives him glory\nSex, drugs, and murder now listen to this story…\nDown here with these devils in the playground\nEvil forces workin’ hard I can’t play around\nI can feel ’em tryin’ to drag me down\nThink I’m gonna lose this battle now\nI’m in the trenches here in Babylon\nThis world of darkness that I travel on\nI know the games that the devil plays\nI feel him creepin’ I can’t get away\nDevils on devils on devils on devils on devils\nThey all in this industry\nNot everybody real, and\nFor the dollar bill friends turn into my enemies\nThey knew I was broke\nSo they asked me to sell my soul\nThree Million dollars plus make a blood sacrifice\nBut I said, “Nooooooo”!\nThis man said if I slept with him he’ll manage me\nYeah, ya’ll know him\nI spit in his face and said, “boy don’t play with me!”\nI said, “Lord this just too much”\nSo I’m just gonna work with church folk\nThen I found out some of these church folk\nBe some of the most crooked on Earth folk\n…\nIt’s entertainment but it’s deeper, though\nBehind the scenes there’s some things you don’t even know\nMessin’ with this game, you could lose your soul\n‘Cause there’s an evil creepin’ deep below\n…\nYou think you the man, don’t ya?\nBut the Devil got his hand on ya\nThe Devil’s just usin’ you\nHe makin’ a fool of you\nYeah, I’m talkin’ to you, you right there\nThe one with the fame, the one with the money\nThe one with the platinum plaques, yeah, yeah\nYou know your name!\nI came in the game with the flame and I aim to be sayin’\nEverything in the name of the Man who created\nThe land, the sand, the sun, and the moon\nHolds life in the palm of his hand\nDo you hear what I’m sayin’?\nMan, I’m really tryin’ to wake you\nThis ain’t no game so I can’t be playful\nSellin’ these lies, music that’s hateful\nThe devil say you great, but God say you ungrateful (echo)\nSo what we gonna do now?\nThis ain’t beef it’s more deep\nI don’t fight for me, I fight for the army of G-O-D\nBut I luv you dawg, my brother for life\nSeparated at birth, but I pray you come to the light Kendrick exposes the satanic music industry “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Kendrick exposes the satanic music industry Dee-1’s claim that the music industry is under the control of Lucifer / the “devil” is a view that Kendrick has also expressed going back to 2015 with the tracks “Alright” and “For Sale? (Interlude)” from *To Pimp a Butterfuly\". In those tracks, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of a music industry leader named “Lucy”, short for Lucifer, who approach Kendrick and offered Kendrick wealth, success, and material possessions if Kendrick would sell his soul to her.\nWhat you want you, a house? You, a car?\nForty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I’m your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it’s illegal\n-“Alright” Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you\nI’ma go hit the throttle with you\nSmoking, lokin’, poking that doja ’til I’m idle with you\n‘Cause I (Want you)\nNow, baby, when I’m riding here, I’m riding dirty\nRegistration is out of service\nSmoking, lokin’, drinking that potion, you can see me swerving\n‘Cause I (Want you)\n(I want you more than you know)\n…\nI remember you took me to the mall last week, baby\nYou looked me in my eyes about four, five times\n‘Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified\nThat I (Want you)\nYou said Sherane ain’t got nothing on Lucy\nI said, “You crazy?”\nRoses are red, violets are blue\nBut me and you both pushing up daisies if I (Want you)\n…\nYou said to me, you said your name was Lucy\nI said, “Where’s Ricardo?”\nYou said, “Oh, no, not the show”\nThen you spit a little rap to me like this\nWhen I turned twenty-six, I was like, “Oh, shit”\nYou said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:\n“My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick\nUsually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick\nLucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories\nAbout these rappers that I came after when they was boring\nLucy gon’ fill your pockets\nLucy gon’ move your mama out of Compton\nInside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised\nLucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?\nIt’s not so easy, I’m at these functions accordingly Kendrick, Lucy don’t slack a minute, Lucy work harder Lucy gon’ call you even when Lucy know you love your Father I’m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly Lucy don’t mind, ‘cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork I want you to know that Lucy got you All your life I watched you And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible”\n-“For Sale (Interlude)” Moreover, a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick released the album GNX which centers around the track “reincarnated” where Kendrick retells the biblical narrative pattern of “Lucifer”. In Kendrick’s retelling, Lucifer is a fallen angel who has been reincarnated numerous times in the form of various musicians whose gluttony led them to use their musical skills and influence to deceive the masses and mentally enslave them under Lucifer’s control.\nI did past life regression last year and it fucked me up\nReincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus\nBody after body, lesson after lesson, let’s take it back to Michigan in 1947\nMy father kicked me out the house ‘cause I wouldn’t listen to him\nI didn’t care about his influence, only loved what I was doing\nGifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level\nThe most talented where I’m from, but I had to rebel\nAnd so I’m off in the sunset, searchin’ for my place in the world\nWith my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled\nI found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect\nWhile the record business loved me\nI was head of rhythm and blues\nThe women that fell to they feet, so many to choose\nBut I manipulated power as I lied to the masses\nDied with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated\n…\nAnother life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin’ Circuit\nSeductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains\nMy voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed\nA musical genius what the articles emphasized\nHad everything I wanted, but I couldn’t escape addiction\nHeroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted\nTurned on my family, I went wherever cameras be\nCocaine, no private planes for my insanity\nSelf-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments\nI needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin\nFuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar\nSex and melodies gave me hope when nobody’s lookin’\nMy first assistant was a small town scholar\nNever did a Quaalude ’til I got myself around her\nMy daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me\nI died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated\n…\nMy present life is Kendrick Lamar\nA rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe\nThe only factor I respected was raisin’ the bar\nMy instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh\nMy father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him\nI’m old enough to understand the way I was livin’\nEgo and pride had me looking at him with resentment\nI close my eyes, hoping that I don’t come off contentious\nI’m yelling, “Father, did I finally get it right?” Everything I did was selfless\nI spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them\nI didn’t gloat, even told ’em, “No,” when the vultures came\nTook control of my fleshly body when the money changed\nSon, you do well, but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\nFather, I’m not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down\n“But your pride has to die,” okay, Father, show me how\nTell me every deed that you done and what you do it for\nI kept one hundred institutions paid\nOkay, tell me more\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage\nOkay, tell me more\nI’m tryna push peace in L.A.\nBut you love war\nNo, I don’t\nOh, yes, you do\nOkay, then tell me the truth\nEvery individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there’s no forgiveness in your heart?\nI could tell you where I’m going\nI could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of Heaven ‘cause you was anxious\nDidn’t like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth ‘cause you was broken\nRehabilitation, not psychosis\nBut now we here now\nCenturies you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evilish views\nAnd all I ever wanted from you was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it’s not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI’m using words for inspiration as an idea\nSo can you promise that you won’t take your gifts for granted?\nI promise that I’ll use my gifts to bring understanding\nFor every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\nYou crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity\nAnd I’m ashamed that I ever created that enemy\nThen let’s rejoice where we at\nI rewrote the devil’s story just to take our power back, ‘carnated\n-“reincarnated” Call It Like It Is “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Call It Like It Is Prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Dee-1 released a podcast episode which discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake. In comparison to Lecrae’s podcast, Dee-1 was much more willing to directly criticize Drake, Kendrick and the culture of rap battles as a whole.\nFrom Dee-1’s uncompromising perspective, the entire battle between Kendrick and Drake has glorified negative examples of hatred and unrighteous relationships that are a detriment to the Black community and misaligned with Jesus’s teaching.\nDee-1 also released an uncompromising response to “Watch the Party Die” in the form a track titled “Call It Like It Is”.\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1\nBut I will—\nYeah, I don’t care what these people think, I’m trying to make these people think\nWhat’s up, Kendrick? We flippin’ tables, man, (Call it like it is), alright\n…\nY’all done turned this culture trash, these so-called legends ain’t no legends\nI don’t care if they sold millions, are you hearin’ their message?\nPoisonin’ our whole community, everybody hypnotized\nWhy you think nobody respect black people?

(Yeah) Time to entertain us with new lies\nWhoever said I’m canceled, man, I’m laughing in these people’s face\nI work for God, dummy, my impact could never be erased\nTell America, I’m the same brother I used to be\nBefore y’all was introduced to me, consistency ain’t new to me\n(So call it like it is) Y’all just sold us all with your foolery\nAnd that dollar bill got y ‘all whipped, that’s dead, man, it’s the eulogy\nAnd whoever said what they gon’ do to me?\nMan, I hit your whole block up with prayers, man, y’all ain’t used to me It is notable that Kendrick does not ask what Dee-1 would do. Given Dee-1’s consistent, uncompromising commitment to Jesus’s teaching above Black identity, hip hop culture, personal grievances or revolutionary philosophies, Kendrick probably knows that Dee-1 would “show ’em just what prayer do” without a second thought.\nKendrick’s contradictions “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Kendrick’s contradictions Kendrick sees within Dee-1 an empathetic, Christ-centered heart that Kendrick has deep inside of himself even while his hardened exterior has led him to advocate for killing the killers, burning the whole village, mortifying family members, cracking skulls, imposing agony, decapitating those who oppose him.\nThis contradiction between Kendricks Christian-leaning heart and his tendencies towards violence (or at least existing in an environment of violence) is a major theme of Kendrick’s work throughout his discography.\nSmokin’ on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nDrank until I can’t no mo’, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nReally I’m a sober soul\nBut I’m with the homies right now\nAnd we ain’t askin’ for no favors\nRush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nReally, I’m a peacemaker\nBut I’m with the homies right now\n-“The Art of Peer Pressure”\nNo better picture to paint than me walkin’ from Bible study\nAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my face\nFrom a function that tooken place, they was wonderin’ if I bang\nStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks\nI don’t mind ‘cause one day you’ll respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d city\n-“good kid”\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey’d probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\n…\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?\nPerceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it’s safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of bein’ a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage\nKill ’em all if they gossip\n-“m.A.A.d city”\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, as blood spilled on your hands**\n-“Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite!\n-“Blacker the Berry”\nThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts, he’s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered\nEnding the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\n-“Mortal Man”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me evolve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\n-“FEAR.”\nI love my father for tellin’ me to take off the gloves\n‘Cause everything he didn’t want was everything I was\n-“Father Time”\nI’m sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody\nOne man standin’ on two words, heal everybody\n…\nWhere’s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today\n-“Mother I Sober” Speaking from the heart “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Speaking from the heart It is worth noting that according to Jesus’s teaching, it is not possible for someone to have a truly empathetic heart if that persons words and actions are not consistently empathetic.\nIn the same speech from St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel where Jesus taught his disciples the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus used a metaphor of trees and fruit to teach his disciples that people who have good in their heart will produce good words and actions and anyone who had evil in their heartwill produce evil words and actions. By contrast, anyone who produces evil words and actions does not truly have good in their hearts.\nBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are greedy wolves. By their fruits you will know them. Can you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. Every tree that doesn’t grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.\n-Matthew 7:15-20 In a parallel speech in St. Lluke’s account of the Gospel according, Jesus gives the same teaching while specifically using the word heart.\nThe good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from the abundance that fills a person’s heart.\n-Luke 6:43-45 Jesus’s warning against false, corrupt prophets is particularly notable given that on “Mortal Man”, throughout “DAMN.” and on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick has spoken about how he is prophet to the Black community in America.\nHence, from the perspective of Jesus’s teaching, Kendrick’s inconsistent actions and words—particularly within “Watch the Party Die”—would seem to indicate that there is a deep inconsistency within Kendrick’s heart as Kendrick’s heart seems to contain both empathy and a pathological desire for ruthless vigilante retribution.\nBut I will— Censored “But I will—” \u003e Censored Unexpectedly, Kendrick never finishes this line. He seems to be censoring himself. We are thus left to guess what Kendrick intended to say (“Dee-1” could be rhymed with “gun”).\nThat being said, the specifics of what the uncensored line might not be that important. Thus far, all the lines on the verses have been advocating for the use of violence to execute people who Kendrick judges to be detrimental to society. Almost surely, the uncensored line would have continued the same trend. The more interesting question is why amongst all the lines that contained profanity and violence, Kendrick picked this line to censor.\nThe censorship here could convey the idea that the uncensored line would have been so extremely violent and direct that it would make the song “X-rated”.\nThe previous time that Kendrick got so specific about the way that he would kill killer was on the track “XXX.” where Kendrick rapped:\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\nX-rated Given that Dee-1 does not use profanity or advocate for people to commit acts of violence, Kendrick’s tendency towards X-rated content again positions Kendrick as someone who is in many ways the exact opposite of Dee-1.\nIt's time to get these devils out the way\nheavy metals on my sword Heavy metals “It’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword” \u003e Heavy metals After previously referring to his execution targets as “degenerates” Kendrick continues to escalate his rhetoric by seemingly referring to them as “devils”. Labeling his execution targets as “devils” again seems to be an attempt to justify certain groups of people with a sword, potentially involving more decapitations.\n“Heavy metal” is a subgenre of rock music which tends to feature violent and spiritually dark imagery in the song lyrics and band names.\nThe original meaning of “heavy metals” refers to a category of chemical elements from the periodic table of elements. Kendrick thus seems to be making a subtle reference to his song “ELEMENT.” where he justified and glorified using violence to take revenge and fight against his enemies.\nI’m willin’ to die for this shit\nI done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit\nPut the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit\nD-O-T my enemy, won’t catch a vibe for this shit, ayy\nI been stomped out in front of my mama\nMy daddy commissary made it to commas\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n…\nI’m willin’ to die for this shit, nigga\nI’ll take your fuckin’ life for this shit, nigga\nWe ain’t goin’ back to broke, family sellin’ dope\nThat’s why you maney-ass rap niggas better know\nIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I’ma make it look sexy\nIf I gotta go hard on a bitch, I’ma make it look sexy\nI pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy\nThey won’t take me out my element\nNah, take me out my element\n…\nI’m allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy\nAn imaginary rich nigga, ayy\nSeven figures ho, that’s slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy\nGoin’ digital and physical on all y’all, ayy\n…\nMost of y’all just envy, but jealousy get you killed\nMost of y’all throw rocks and try to hide your hand\nJust say his name and I promise that you’ll see Candyman Spiritual swordfights “It’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword” \u003e Spiritual swordfights It is notable that in St. Paul’s letter to the Church in Ephesus, St. Paul uses the imagery of armor, swords and warfare as a metaphor to describe how Christians should fight against spiritual forces including the “devi” (aka “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) and the “element” forces of the world.\nFinally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the methodology of the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”]. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the element, against the powers, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.\nTherefore put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of right relationships, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News (aka Gospel) of peace, above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints.\n-Ephesians 6:10-18 In that passage, St. Paul makes it clear that Christians are not meant to be fighting or killing other humans (or as St. Paul says “flesh and blood”), because other humans are never the real enemy. Instead, St. Paul instructs the member of the church to go to war against “spiritual forces of wickedness”, not the humans who are doing things that are “too wicked to apologize”.\nIn order to defend against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to put on “spiritual armor” which refers to virtues such as truth, right relationships, peace derived from Jesus’s Good News, faith, salvation.\nIn order to fight offensively against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to wield “the sword of the Spirit” which is a metaphor for the “word of God” that is conveyed though Jesus’s teachings as told in the texts of Bible.\nSt. Paul also instructs Christians to fight the spiritual war “with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit.”\nSimilarly, in St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul made it clear that Christians are not meant to use physical weapons to fight against human enemies but spiritual weapons to fight against prideful patterns and thoughts and arguments which attempt to exalt themselves to make mak humans act according to those prideful patterns of thoughts and arguments instead of obeying Jesus’s commandments.\nFor though we walk in the [flesh / body], we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires], for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying arguments and all pride that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ.\n-2 Corinthians 10:3-5 Hence, St. Paul clearly teaches Christians to “show ’em what prayer do”. Moreover, St. Paul also instructs Christians to be transformed by Jesus’s teaching so that they can develop the kinds of virtues that will allow them to fight against prideful thoughts and arguments that would justify wickedness, including any acuments that would justify brutally killing other humans.\nWe settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce “We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce” \u003e Hollywood divorce “Hard” seems to be connected to the idea of “heavy metal” on the previous line. These “hard disputes” seem to be part of some unresolvable marital conflict that will eventually end in divorce. Based on the context of the song, it would seem that Kendrick plans to settle these “hard disputes” by killing the people with whom he has a dispute.\nAdditionally, the reference to a “ghetto Hollywood divorce”, suggests that the dispute could be “contract dispute” between Black artists and an entertainment industry company.\nHere Kendrick seems to be commenting on the relationship that “corporate guys” and “rappers who tell the lies” have forged to profit from distributing fabricated stories about being “street niggas just like Hollywood has profited from distributing fabricated stories.\nKendrick also seems to be alluding to the Outkast song “Hollywood Divorce”, in which Outkast, Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg used the image of a volatile Hollywood celebrity marriage as an extended metaphor for how entertainment industries appropriate Black culture only to later divorce themselves from the Black artists while holding on to the profits and intellectual property.\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n…\nAnd I’m a star\nYeah, and I don’t have to go to Hollywood\n‘Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on\nI really think they’re stealing from us like a sample song\nI really wish one day we’d take it back like Hammer’s home\nThe hurricane come and took my Louisiana home\nAnd all I got in return was a durn country song\nThis whole country wrong\nOh, but you right if you just put a little ice on\nAnd cut your mic on but you don’t even write songs\nBut Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra\nI’m so not sober, I’m high like a Hollywood\nCoffee or soda, you can call me a roller\nHold up, your grill’s glistenin’\nSpent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different\nWhat’s the real sense of it?\nBling bling, I know and did you know\nI’m the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm\nThey let it sit too long, they just makin’ it burn\nMake a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn\nLike a dead body burned on the mantle piece\nThat’s why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease\nAnd I be’s the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze\nDefrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne\nBut in Hollywood it’s Litt-le Wayne, don’t make me none\nSo that’s why I got a pre-nup\nI do\n…\nI do, love you but you hate me at the same time\nLights, camera, action, it’s game time\nDo you take this here as your lovely wife?\nTo love her and cherish her for all your life?\nI solemnly swear to dare share and take you there\nAnd me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair\nIt’s been a long time, we walked a thin line\nOthers say they got you, but you been mine\nAs I sit back and watch all the catfights\nDomestic violence — is that right?\nBut you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight\nAnd now I’m growin’ up, showin’ up, blowin’ up\nI never ever thought that we would separate at all\nBut you played me like a game of football\nUsed to feed me, need me, dress me\nNow it’s so messy, straight cut out and left me\n…\n(Starts off like a small town marriage)\nHollywood divorce\nAll the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing\n(Lively wife and life, baby carriage)\nLook at blues, rock, jazz, rap\n(Now all the stars have cars, success of course)\nNot even talkin’ about music\nEverything else, too\n(But it ends in Hollywood divorce)\nBy the time it reach Hollywood, it’s over\n(Hollywood divorce)\nBut it’s cool\nWe just keep it goin’ and make new shit\nTake our game, take our name\nGive us a little fame\nAnd then they kick us to the curb, that’s a cold thang Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores\nYou let ’em snack, they eat your face Culture vultures “Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores” \u003e Culture vultures With the line, “the culture bred with carnivores”, Kendrick seems to be alluding to the famously influential lines from Jay-Z’s 2001 song “Izzo” in which Jay-Z describe corporate leaders in the music industry as “vultures” who scavenge off Black culture\nI do this for my culture, to let ’em know\nWhat a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster\nShow ’em how to move in a room full of vultures\nIndustry shady, it need to be taken over\nLabel owners hate me, I’m raisin’ the status quo up\nI’m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush\nPay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us\nWe can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks More recently in Migos’s 2017 track, “T-Shirt” from their album “Culture”, Migos member, Quavo, referenced those lines from “Izzo” while discussing how “vultures” will “bite”, which is slang for stealing.\nDo it for the culture (Culture)\nThey gon’ bite like vultures (Vultures) The carnivores that Kendrick mention here thus seem to be culture vultures who will eat artists for a snack. Kendrick specifically mentions that the carnivores will “eat your face”, which conveys the idea that cultures vultures seek to erase an artist’s identity along with any associate or credit that the artist would have to their work. In the phrase “bred with carnivores”, the word “bred” primarily refers to the reproduction of vulture from one generation to the next. However, “bred” is also a double entendre for the food item “bread” which connects to the idea of vulture eating. This line then turns into a triple entendre when we realize that “bread” is also slang for “money” which would indicate that the “corporate guys” from the entertainment industry are eating up all the money that rightfully belongs to the artist.\nBy saying “Say hello to your future fate”, Kendrick seems to be asserting that getting eaten and erased by culture vultures is guaranteed to be the fate of any artist who remains trapped in the grip of the entertainment industry for any substatial amount of time.\nthe signatures is bein’ forged Forged signatures “the signatures is bein’ forged” \u003e Forged signatures Kendrick seems to be warning other hip hop artists about the hard disputes and metaphorical divorce that will happen to them in the future if they sign a contract with an exploitative entertainment company.\nThe word “forged” refers to a fake signature that is used to establihs a fraudulent legal agreement but is also double entendre referring to the process of shaping metal into a weapon, tool or object. This connects back to previous line about “heavy metals on my sword” that was used to “get these devils out the way”.\nThe idea that the signatures are being “forged” indicates that the “corporate guys” in the entertainment industry are actually committing acts of fraud to illegally profit from “rappers that report the lies” and use the leverage of paid lawyers and the legal system against Black artists.\nThe imagery of signatures from the entertainment industry also brings to mind the To Pimp a Butterfly track “For Sale? (Interlude)” in which Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) comes to Kendrick in the form of a music industry executive named Lucy. Lucy tries to get Kendrick to sign a contract to sell his soul to her in exchange for wealth, possessions and an agreement that Kendrick will stop praying and abandon his loving relationship with God the Father.\nMy name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick\nUsually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick\nLucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories\nAbout these rappers that I came after when they was boring\nLucy gon’ fill your pockets\nLucy gon’ move your mama out of Compton\nInside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised\nLucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?\nIt’s not so easy, I’m at these functions accordingly\nKendrick, Lucy don’t slack a minute, Lucy work harder\nLucy gon’ call you even when Lucy know you love your Father\nI’m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly\nLucy don’t mind, ‘cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me\nLucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front\nLucy got paperwork on top of paperwork\nI want you to know that Lucy got you\nAll your life I watched you\nAnd now you all grown up to sign this contract,\nif that’s possible They wonder why I’m not enthused to drop subsection “They wonder why I’m not enthused to drop” \u003e Drop The word “drop” refers to Kendrick releasing or “dropping” a new album, which is something that had been heavily anticipated during and after the battle with Drake.\nAfter hearing about sexual predators, unfaithful corporate partners, fraudulent devils and culture vultures in the entertainment industry it is no wonder that Kendrick is unenthusiastic about dropping a new album.\nA few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would release his next full length album, GNX. Throughout GNX Kendrick discusse the challenges of navigating through the evil, satanic control of the entertainment industry, particular on the track “reincarnated”. The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried More visible, more tried “The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried” \u003e More visible, more tried After focusing on the justification for committing acts of physical violence against his enemies, it is notable that this is the first time on either verse where Kendrick has really focused on how he is being tested and tried spiritually.\nKendrick seems to be expressing the idea that he and other true artists face increasingly difficult struggles and trials as they become increasingly famous and visible to the public.\nThis line expresses a similar idea and ethos to the Notorious B.I.G., Ma$e and Diddy’s famous song “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems”\nI don’t know what they want from me\nIt’s like the more money we come across\nThe more problems we see The challenge of being tried spiritually seems to be one of the main reasons that Kendrick is “not enthused to drop” a new album, since droping a new album will only increase his visibility and his trials. The idea of increased spiritually trials coming after increased visibility is also illustrated in Gospel accounts which describe how Jesus was tried by the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accusers” / “diabolical one”] immediately after God the Father opened the skies, spoke audibly to declare that Jesus was his “beloved son” and sent the Holy Spirit in the visible form of a dove to show that Jesus is the anointed king (aka the Christ) over God’s people.\nAfter Jesus was baptized, he came up immediately from the water; and behold, the skies were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him, and behold, a voice from the skies said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil.\n-Matthew 3:16-4:1 It’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified Petrified “It’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified” \u003e Petrified For the last few lines Kendrick has been shown himself to be very cynical about the entertainment industry, which gobbles up artists like vultures. Artists who recognize the dangers of the entertainment industry are understandably afraid and even “petrified”.\nWhile the word “petrified” can be used as a synonym for “afraid”, the most concreate meaning of “petrified” refers to any kind of organic plant or animal material that is turned into stone. Organic material is petrified when water brings small minerals into the formerly living plant or animal and slowly replaces all of the organic flesh with rock-hard material.\nBecoming “petrified” actually serves as a great metaphor for hip hop as a living, flexible, organic culture being infiltrated by slick corporate guys and entertainment companies who kill hip hop artists (or more specifically kill hip hop artists consciousness as Kendrick mentioned in “Worldwide Steppers”) then seek to replace the flexible, organic culture of hip hop with a rock hard, inflexible, inorganic focus on making profit. This process eventually turns Black artists into hard-hearted individuals who are deadened to the world and can no longer grow.\nIt is notable that the within the Old Testament, the Prophet Ezekiel explained that God had allowed the Israelites to be defeated, dispursed and enslaved because of they had hearts of stone which did not desire God or the justice that comes from God. However, Ezekiel also prophesied about a day in the future when God would free them from slavery, bring them back to their own land and transform their old hearts of stone into new hearts of flesh which would truly desire God and be able to act with justice.\nFor I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols. I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the heart of stone out of your bodies, and I will give you a heart of flesh. I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my prescriptions. You will obey my justice and do just acts. You will reside in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God.\n-Ezekiel 36:24-28 From a biblical pespective, becoming “petrified” is thus equivalent to being enslaved or imprisoned by an oppressor due to idolatrous desire for material possessions.\nThe end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies End result “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e End result Kendrick suggests that dealing with the evils of the entertainment industry can only lead to two possible end results for artists: Either the artist will be locked up “in jail by Jezebel” or “drugged up full of lies”.\nWith either of these results, the artist will lose the freedom to create truthful works of art. Jezebel “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e Jezebel As mentioned in the analysis of the line “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time”, Jezebel was a wicked woman who became queen of the Northern Kingdom of Israel after she married a wicked king named Ahab.After becoming queen, Jezebel replaced the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with the worship of the fertility god name Ba’al. Queen Jezebel then either killed or imprisoned most of the true prophets of God, while a hundred of God’s prophets escaped to hide in caves.\nThe prophet Elijah was the only prophet who was protected and empowered to openly confront Queen Jezebel and King Ahab. Elijah challenged the prophets of the fertility Ba’al to a competition to in which the prophets of Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Ba’al, the fertility god, would each ask the deity whom they worshiped to send down fire from the skies to burn up a sacrifice on an altar.\nAfter Yahweh, the God of Israel, proved to be the only deity capable of sending down fire from the skies, Elijah compelled the Israelites to round up the prophets of Ba’al and kill them.\nThe death of Ba’al’s prophets enraged Queen Jezebel. Shen then swore that she would kill Elijah, which caused Elijah to run for his life. Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet on “Mortal Man”, throughout DAMN. and at severl moments on other tracks. Here in “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick the seems see himself as the modern equivalent of the prophet Elijah who is at risk of having his artistic output locked up by the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry.\nDrugged up “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e Drugged up The term “drugged up” is used to describe a person who is noticeably being under the influence of drugs, whether prescription drugs or recreational drugs.\nIn many cases, someone who is “drugged up” may not be fully aware of their surroundings and thus is in a vulernable state in which someone could take advantage of them.\nThe idea of being drugged up connects back to the earlier reference to the drug MDMA in the line “Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies”.\nIn the current line, Kendrick seems to imply that artists who are have succumbed to their desires from pleasure and the exploitation of the entertainment industry will be drugged up with “lies”.\nThe idea of artists being under the influence of lies also connects back to earlier lines where Kendrick ordered the execution of those who told lies or failed to provide truth to their young audience.\nIf you parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth\nThe graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose\n…\nI think it’s time to watch the party die\nStreet niggas and the corporate guys\nthe rappers that report the lies In the current line, Kendrick seems to suggest that the minds of “rappers that report the lies” eventually become altered and distorted as they become intoxicated by the lies that they have consumed and are not regurgitating to the masses.\nBeing “drugged up” may also lead a person to lose consciousness.\nFittingly, since the 1990s the word “conscious” has been used to describe hip hop artists such as Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Lupe Fiasco who do not gloryify violence, drugs, sexual misbehavior, gluttony, jewelry, poor financial decisions, or any other form of ignorance that might be common in commercialized, mainstream hip hop. Instead, these artists focused on positive messages that would uplift the Black community. “Conscious” hip hop artists are thus the exact opposite of the “rappers that report the lies” and become “drugged up full of lies”\nThroughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Stepper Kendrick also discussed the concept of “conciousness” as being free from ego, aware, present in “now”, and connected to the universal or “collective consciousness” as described in the New Age teachings of Eckhart Tolle.\nThe media’s the new religion, you killed the consciousness -“Worldwide Steppers”\n(You really wanna know?) Do you want peace?\n(How I get so low?) Then watch us in the street\n(Only one way to go) One protest for you\n(Higher) Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)\nVladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)\nBut that’s how we all think (Only one way to go)\nThe collective conscious (Higher)\nCalamities on repeat, huh\n-“Savior”\n*Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\n*Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\n-“The Heart Part 5” In some cases the term, “drugged up” or just “drugged” may also be used to describe women (or sometimes men) who have unknowingly consumed a drug that was given to them by a sexual predator who intends to sexually assault or abuse the “drugged” person once they lose awareness or consciousness.\nThe idea of sexual assault could imply that rappers and artists are being “drugged up full of lies” because they are being “fucked over” by the predatory leaders of the entertainment industry. Kendrick previously asserted that artists are getting duped into unfaithful relationships, “fucked over”, and killed by the entertainment industry on the track “N95” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Stepper.\nThe industry wants\nNiggas and bitches to sleep in a box\nWhile they makin’ a mockery followin’ us\nThis ain’t Monopoly\nWatchin’ for love\nThis ain’t monogamy\nY’all gettin’ fucked The idea of sexual assault could also connect back to Kendrick allegagions of Drake and his crew being sexual predators who traffic girls to sex parties at Drake’s mansion.\nCritical, I know my physical is tested all the time Tested “Critical, I know my physical is tested all the time” \u003e Tested In addition to being spiritually tried, Kendrick is know that he must endure being physically tested. I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride The Sunken Place “I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride” \u003e The “Sunken Place” Here Kendrick talks about being pitiful and in the “Sunken Place”, which is a reference to the movie Get Out.\nIn Get Out a Black male protagonist named Chris goes to visit his white girlfriend’s wealthy family at a secluded estate. Although the family is very friendly—actually too friendly—he begins to notice strange behavior, particularly from the Black woman who serves as housekeeper and the Black man who serves as a groundskeeper.\nOne evening, the Black protagonist has a private conversation with his white girlfriend’s mother. The mother starts asking very probing questions about his personal trauma while using the sound of a spoon stirring around a teacup to hypnotize the Black protagonist.\nAs he talks about his traumatic life experiences the Black protagonist feels pitiful and soon becomes paralyzed and cannot move even though he is still awake. However, then the mother says “Now sink into the floor. Sink!”\nAt that point the Black protagonist’s consciousness becomes totally disconnected or dissociated from his body and sent down to what the mother calls “the sunken place”. In the “sunken place” he faintly see what’s going on around him but is unable to move his body or do anything about it.\nLater on the White mother keeps the Black protagonist in the hypnotized state long enough to strap him to a restraining chair in the basement. The Black protagonist then learns that the family uses the daughter to attract black people and bring them to her family’s estate where they are hypnotized with the consciousness sent to the sunken place. The family then takes over the Black person’s body and transfers the consciousness of older, “degenerate” White person into the Black person’s stolen body stolen body.\nThe protagonists learns that Black woman who is serving as the housekeeper and the Black man who is serving as the groundskeeper are Black people whose bodies were previously stolen so that their consciousness could be replaced by the consciousness of the girlfriend’s grandmother and grandfather respectively.\nThe Black protagonist refuses to be a victim of this plot. He manages to free himself from the restraining chair before his body is stolen and kill several members of the family before escaping from the estate with the help of his Black friend. Kendrick seems to be referencing the plot of Get Out as a metaphor for what the White-owned entertainment industry is doing to Black artists and Black culture.\nThe White owned entertainment industry is sending out corporate White folks to attract Black artists to come join the the White entertainment industry.\nOnce the Black artist is in the building, the White industry folks hypnotize and paralyze Black artists by getting them to keep talking about their traumatic life experiences until they feel pitiful.\nThis is similar to the experiences that Kendrick alluded to on “Mother I Sober” when he rapped:\n“Traded in my tears for a Range Rover” The White industry folk then forces the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness (aka the “Sunken Place”) where they become disconnected and dissociated from what’s going on around them.\nAfter forcing the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness, the White corporate industry folk can then steal the Black artist’s body of work (e.g. the master recording of a music artist) and give it to a degenerate White person to own as his or her own body of work while the Black artist is still trapped in the “Sunken Place”.\nIt is notable that the word “corporate” comes from the Latin word “corporātiō” which literally means “the assumption or taking on of a body”\nThis idea of stealing a Black artist’s body (of work) also mirrors the metaphor of petrification where White corporate industry folk kill the Black artist’s consciousness, penetrate into their body of work, and slowly replace the flexible, organic flesh with rock hard, inflexible, inorganic minerals until the body is just a hard relic of a past life. Kendrick, like the protagonists of Get Out is one of the few Black artists who has been able to regain consciousness, free himself from the restraints of his original contract, and now seems poised to kill the White industry folk so that he can escape before they try to send his consciousness back to the “Sunken Place.”\nPride “I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride” \u003e Pride It is notable that Kendrick finds himself in the “Sunken Place” whenever he “questions his pride”. The might convey the idea that the entertainment industry wants Kendrick to remain under the influence of his own pride, so that he will make bad decisions and be easier to control.\nKendrick has discussed his internal struggle between pride and humility throughout much of his work.\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\n-“Real”\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me\n…\nSick venom in men and women overcome with pride\nA perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies\nPromises are broken and more resentment come alive\nRace barriers make inferior of you and I\nSee, in a perfect world, I’ll choose faith over riches\nI’ll choose work over bitches, I’ll make schools out of prison\nI’ll take all the religions and put ’em all in one service\nJust to tell ’em we ain’t shit, but He’s been perfect, world\n-“PRIDE.”\nBitch, be humble (Hold up, bitch)\nSit down (Hold up, lil’— hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, bitch)\nSit down (Hold up, sit down, lil’— sit down, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBitch, sit down (Hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, bitch)\n-“HUMBLE.”\nI’m chargin’ baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance\nOh, this the part where mental stability meets talent\nOh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice\nTactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues\n-“Father Time”\nWipe my ego, dodge my pride\n(And I’m tripping and falling)\nLook myself in the mirror\nAmityville, ain’t seen nothin’ scarier\n-“Count Me Out” I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time Seeing ghosts “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Seeing ghosts Kendricks spiritual trials and physical tests seem to push him to the point where he is “seeing ghosts.”\nOn “Mother I Sober”, the pivotal track from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick mentioned seeing the ghost of his maternal grandmother as he struggled to break a generation curse through therapy.\nMy mother’s mother followed me for years in her afterlife\nStarin’ at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night\nLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover Blacking out “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Blacking out The term “blacking out” typically refers to the experience of going into a state of unconsciousness. The idea of unconscioussness connects back to the idea of artists being “drugged up full of lies” as discussed in a previous line. Relapsing “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Relapsing A “relapse” is a setback in deteriation in someone’s health after previous improvement. The term is most often used to describe the experience in which someone who had previously broken free from an addiction to a drug or stimulating activity returns to their addiction.\nWithin the context of “Watch the Party Die” a “relapsin’ one thought at a time” might imply that the spiritual and physical struggles with the entertainment industry are causing Kendrick to fall back into destructive ways of thought after previously being “drugged up full of lies.”\nIt is notable that throughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick reveals his struggle with sex addition that was exacerbated by being a famous touring artist in the entertainment industry.\nI met her on the third night of Chicago\nNorth America tour, my eyes closed\nFee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model\nDedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible\nEyes light green, penetratin’ the moonlight\nHair done in a bun, energy in the room like\nBig Bang for theory, God, hopin’ you hear me\nPhone off the ringer, tell the world I’m busy\nFair enough, green eyes said her mother didn’t care enough\nSympathize when her daddy in the chain gang\nHer first brother got killed, he was 21\nI was nine when they put Lamont in the grave\nHeartbroken when Estelle didn’t say goodbye\nChad left his body after we FaceTimed\nGreen eyes said you’d be okay, first tour, sex the pain away\nI grieve different\n-“United in Grief”\nAsk Whitney about my lust addiction\nText messagin’ bitches got my thumbs hurt\n…\nSciatica nerve pinch, I don’t know how to feel\nI don’t know how to feel\nLike the first time I fucked a white bitch\nThe first time I fucked a white bitch\nI was sixteen at the Palisades\nFumblin’ my grades, I traveled with the team\nThe apache life, Centennial was like\nWhen Ms. Baker screamed at Doughboy\nMixed that with Purple Rain\nThey interchanged the seams\nHappy just to be out the hood\nWith all the wealthy kids\nCredit cards and family plans\nShe drove her daddy’s Benz\nI found out that he was a sheriff\nThat was a win-win\nBecause he had locked up Uncle Perry\nShe paid her daddy’s sins\nNext time I fucked a white bitch\nWas out in Copenhagen\ngood kid, m.A.A.d city tour\nI flourished on them stages\nWhitney asked did I have a problem\nI said, “I might be racist”\nAncestors watchin’ me fuck was like retaliation\n-“Worldwide Steppers”\nI was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind\nI need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined\nI did it sober sittin’ with myself, I went through all emotions\nNo dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer\nIntoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\n… I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin’ manhood\nBut Whitney’s gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could\nAll those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract\n-“Mother I Sober” One thought at a time “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e One thought at a time Kendrick seems to realize that his susceptibility to addition is fueled by his own pattern of thoughts. This echoes St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians in which he told Chrsitians that they are not fighting a physical battle against other humans but a spiritual battle against arrogant thoughts and arguments that lead to prideful exaltation and prevent humans from knowing God in a loving relationship.\nFor though we walk in the [flesh / body], we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires], for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying arguments and all arrogance that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ.\n-2 Corinthians 10:3-5 I spare no feelings that ain’t mine Spare no feeling “I spare no feelings that ain’t mine” \u003e Spare no feeling The phrase “spare no feelings” describes someone who is acting without any concern of how his or her actions could hurt someone else’s feelings.\nKendrick’s relapse seems to have put him into a mental state where he only cares about his own feelings and no longer cares about the feelings of others. Such a state of mind is the exact opposite of empathy and thus undermines the earlier line when he said “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1”\nKendrick previously expressed his paranoid, troubled and unempathetic state of mind when he was overwhelmed by his feelings on the track “FEEL.” from DAMN..\nI feel like a chip on my shoulders\nI feel like I’m losin’ my focus\nI feel like I’m losin’ my patience\nI feel like my thoughts in the basement\nFeel like, I feel like you’re miseducated\nFeel like I don’t wanna be bothered\nI feel like you may be the problem\nI feel like it ain’t no tomorrow, fuck the world\nThe world is endin’, I’m done pretendin’\nAnd fuck you if you get offended\nI feel like friends been overrated\nI feel like the family been fakin’\nI feel like the feelings are changin’\nFeel like my thought of compromise is jaded\nFeel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it\nFeel like I ain’t feelin’ you all\nFeel like removin’ myself, no feelings involved\nI feel for you, I’ve been in the field for you\nIt’s real for you, right?

I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean In my feelings “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e In my feelings To be “in one’s feelings” refers to a mental state in which someone is so emotionally dysregulated, overwhelmed or affected that they can no longer think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.\nIt is notable that “In My Feelings” is also the title of Drake’s record-breaking number one single from his 2018 album, Scorpion. On the track, Drake sings and raps about many of his typical themes including his feelings and sexual desire for numerous women.\nTrap, TrapMoneyBenny\nThis shit got me in my feelings*\nGotta be real with it, yeah\nKiki, do you love me? Are you riding?\nSay you’ll never ever leave from beside me\n‘Cause I want ya, and I need ya\nAnd I’m down for you always\nKB, do you love me? Are you riding?\nSay you’ll never ever leave from beside me\n‘Cause I want ya, and I need ya\nAnd I’m down for you always “In My Feelings” also exemplifies how Drake has used social media, influencers and corporate marketing tactics to significantly increase his commercial success. On the same day that the album Scorpion was released, a social media comedian named Shiggy posted a video of him dancing to this chorus. This video soon went viral and was then turned into a the social media #InMyFeelingsChallenge and #KikiChallenge which later added riskier elements like dancing outside of moving cars. These viral trends helped to elevate the track to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart giving Drake the record for most number one hits of rapper in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nSlide “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e Slide Within the context Kendrick’s lyrics “slide” is usually slang for the act of killing someone.\nI said, tell me who you loyal to\nIs it anybody that you would lie for?\nAnybody you would slide for?\nAnybody you would die for?\n-“LOYALTY.”\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\n…\nI caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community\nMy last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies\nNot because the rags in the park had red gradient\nBut because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin’\n-“Worldwide Steppers” By saing “I’m in my feelings when I slide”, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that whenever he tries to kill (aka slide) people, he is only doing so because he is emotionally dysregulated and unable to think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.\nThis line thus gives a whole new perspective and context to “Watch the Party Die”. The whole time that he has been advocating to kill the killers and commit acts of unspeakable violence may really just be evidence that Kendrick is emotionally dysregulated and unable to consider the ramifications or consequences of his words and actions. He seems to have been in a totally “unconscious” state throughout this track.\nBy the same logic, one could also conclude that throughout the battle tracks where Kendrick seemingly tried to kill Drake’s career, Kendrick was “in his feelings” and unable to be empathetic towards Drake.\nA few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick released the track “reincarnated” as the centerpiece of the album GNX , Kendrick seemed to confirm that his actions during the battle with Drake were largely a result of Kendrick being “in his feelings”. On “reincarnated” Kendrick rapped from the perspective of God the Father who told Kendrick that he was a reincarnated version of Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accusers” / “diabolical one”) who “loved war” and and was kicked out of heaven because his feelings of anxiety led him to do evil. In response, Kendrick acknowledged that all he ever really wanted was to feel “love and approval”.\n\"Son you do well but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\"\nFather I’m not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down\n“But your pride has to die, \"\nOkay father show me how\n“Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for”\nI kept one hundred institutions paid, “Okay, tell me more”\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage, “Okay, tell me more”\nI’m tryna push peace in LA, “But you love war”\nNo, I don’t, “Oh, yes, you do, \" okay then tell me the truth\n“Every individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there’s no forgiveness in your heart?”\nI could tell You where I’m going, “I could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of heaven ‘cause you was anxious\nDidn’t like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth ‘cause you was broken\nRehabilitation not psychosis\nBut now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evil-ish views”\nAnd all I ever wanted from You was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it’s not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI’m using words for inspiration as an ideal\n“So can you promise that you won’t take your gifts for granted?”\nI promise that I’ll use my gifts to bring understanding\n“For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?”\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\n“You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity”\nAnd I’m ashamed that I ever created that enemy Toosie Slide “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e Toosie Slide In addition to using the word “slide” to refer to killing, on the battle track, “6:16 in LA”, Kendrick used the word “slide” in reference to “Toosie Slide”, Drake’s number one hit and accompanying viral dance trend from 2020.\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\nCan’t Toosie Slide up outta this one, it’s just gon’ resurface\nEvery dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose It is notable that Drake used influencers and viral social media trends to significantly increase the commercial success of “Toosie Slide” in a more enhanced version of his strategy for “In My Feelings” four years earlier.\n“Toosie Slide” was released as a single in April, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns and named after a then 23 year old named Toosie.\nToosie is a Black social media dancer and influencer from Atlanta who had a big break into the music industry when he linked up with fellow Atlanta-native and rapper Future eventually joining Future on the Summer Sixteen Tour with Future, a tour which also features Drake.\nWhen Drake needed another social media dance trend to popularize a new song, he direct messaged Toosie on social media and asked Toosie to make up a dance based on the hook of an unfinished song. That request turned into a modern “Cha Cha Slide”-style dance and viral social media video which featured the song’s hook.\nThe fact that Drake used his connection with Atlanta native rapper, Future, and Future’s Atlanta native dancer, Toosie, also highlights the criticism that Kendrick made on “Not Like Us”. Throughout the third verse of “Not Like Us” Kendrick accused Drake of colonizing Black culture particularly by using Atlanta-based artists to make commercialized hits that could make Drake rich.\nOnce upon a time, all of us was in chains\nHomie still doubled down callin’ us some slaves\nAtlanta was the Mecca, buildin’ railroads and trains\nBear with me for a second, let me put y’all on game\nThe settlers was usin’ townfolk to make ’em richer\nFast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer After Toosie’s video had already gone viral Drake released the official music video for the full song which was now titled “Toosie Slide”. The video showed Drake wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask and doing Toosi’s dance while going through a tour of his mansion during the COVID lockdown.\nOn the surface, “Toosie Slide” seems like just a dance song with melodies.\nBaby, don’t you wanna dance with me? No?\nI could dance like Michael Jackson\nI could give you satisfaction\nAnd you know we out here every day with it\nI’ma show you how to get it\n…\nIt go right foot up, left foot, slide\nLeft foot up, right foot, slide\nBasically, I’m sayin’, either way, we ‘bout to slide, ayy\nCan’t let this one slide, ayy (Who’s bad?) However, if one pays close attention to the lyrics one can hear that Drake is actually trying to “act tough” and portay himself as a “street nigga” as he uses the word “slide” to simultaneously refer to the dance and to the act of vengefully killing his enemies.\nGot so many opps, I be mistakin’ opps for other opps\nGot so many people that I love out of troubled spots\nOther than the family I got, it’s either you or me\nThat’s just how I think, it’s either you or me\nThis life got too deep for you, baby\nTwo or three of us about to creep where they stayin’\n…\nBlack leather glove, no sequins\nBuckles on the jacket, it’s Alyx shit\nNike crossbody, got a piece in it\nGot a dance, but it’s really on some street shit\nI’ma show you how to get it* It is notable that on the battle track “euphoria” Kendrick says that he would like Drake to keep making songs with catchy melodies that make everyone dance instead of trying to “act tough”. Kendrick even implied that if Drake focused on making dance songs, Kendrick would have no reason to threaten Drake with diss songs.\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n…\nStill love when you see success, everything with me is blessed\nKeep makin’ me dance, wavin’ my hand, and it won’t be no threat At the end of the battle track “Not Like Us”, Kendrick also seems to mock Drake’s attempt to make viral dance hits like “Toosie Slide” by chanting the following dance instructions:\nLet me hear you say, “OV-ho” (OV-ho)\nSay, “OV-ho” (OV-ho)\nThen step this way, step that way\nThen step this way, step that way Also on the video for “Not Like Us”, there is scene where Kendrick is standing on a dark street. Just behinda Kendrick, a menacing man approaches wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask just like Drake did in the “Toosie Slide” video. However, before the man has a chance to put a hand on Kendrick the man is suddenly thrown backwards almost as if there was some kind of supernatural force protecting Kendrick.\nAll of these references to “Toosie Slide” along with the slang meaning of “slide” seem to suggest that Drake’s actions over a number of years are the exact things that Kendrick has judged to be punishable by execution throughout “Watch the Party Die”.\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do Lecrae “A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do” \u003e Lecrae Kendrick transitions away from discussion on his spiritual, physical and emotional trials withing the entertainment industry and once again wonders out loud what Lecrae would do as a Black man and a hip hop artist who has faced many similar trials and challenges.\nIt is notable that instead of saying “I wonder what Lecrae would do\", he now says “a nigga wonder what Lecrae would do\", almost as if it is a question that any Black person should be wondering.\nFor context, Lecrae has had to deal with his fair share of public controversy and conflict with White Christians who began to take offense at Lecrae when after Lecdrated started speaking about racial justice issues that were affecting the Black community.\nBecause White (Evangelical) Christians represent the largest consumer demographic for Christian hip hop, speaking out about racial justice put Lecrae at odds with the White -wned entertainment industry who wanted to co-opt his music and act like they owned him. Lecraes details these dynamics on several tracks on Lecrae’s 2017 album All Things Work Together for Good.\nLearned a lot over these last few years\nIndustry people ain’t friends, just peers\n…\nStill killin’ over colors, now it’s black and blue\nWe dyin’ every day, B, we just don’t make the news\nWhen you speak out for your race, just watch\nThey gon’ twist and say you hate these cops\nI’ma take these shots\nHow can he love Jesus, Kanye, and K-Dot?\nMartin, Malcolm, and Schaeffer, Mitsubishi, and Maybach?\nContradictory, nah, it’s complimentary\nUnderstanding me ain’t for the simple and elementary, oh\n-“Always Knew” People wonder, “Is he woke or just a new slave?”\nOld religion, he just covered it with new chains\nChoppin’ out the church, he ain’t real, he fake\nHe divisive, he don’t rep the King, he just want the fame\nAw man, now they actin’ like I’m suddenly political\nTold me shut my mouth and get my checks from Evangelicals\nBoy, my momma raised me, on Angela and Eldridge\nChuck Berry made it, but the credit went to Elvis\nKnow you never knew that, know you think I’m too black\nI just think I’m too real, I grew up on 2Pac\nYou grew up thinkin’ that the Panthers was some terrorists\nI grew up hearin’ how they fed my momma eggs and grits\n\"‘Crae, they say you should follow in the steps of King\"\nI say, “You’ve forgotten how they shot him in the streets”\nI ain’t really changed, it’s the same old rebel\nStill a radical, I’m passionate, it’s just another level (leggo!)\nAT told me I should fight back\nThey don’t like that (they don’t)\nJust know if you rock the boat you better have a life raft (what?)\n…\nNow these people swear they own me, sendin’ out threats\nTold me keep my mouth shut, told me be a Stepin Fetchit\nI will not oblige to your colonized way of faith\nMy Messiah died for the world, not just USA\nThey say, “Jesus was Conservative”\nTell ’em, “That’s a lie”\nNo, He not a Liberal either if you think I’ll choose a side\nThey say, “‘Crae, you so divisive, shouldn’t be a black church”\nI say, “Do the math, segregation started that first!”\nHey, you want unity?

(Interlude)”, “King Kunta”, “These Walls”, “For Sale?”, “Complexion (A Zulu Love)”, “Complexion (A Zulu Love)”, “untitled 05|09.21.2014”, and “Loyalty”.\nGiven how much he has witnessed Kendrick creative process up close over multiple years and projects, Terrance Martin would know more than most people that Kendrick’s mind is always thinking on multiple layers while trying to give truth to the youth.\nI flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues Flood the market “I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues” \u003e Flood the market “Flooding the market” refers to the act of releasing a large quantity of a particular product into the a particular market in a short period of time.\nFor Kendrick, flooding the market could refer to the release of the current track and a subsequent album which would flood the music market with sales and streams. The idea of “streaming” music also connects to the theme of water introduced by the word “flood”. I paid your dues “I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues” \u003e I paid your dues The idea of a market where people pay for goods and services also connects to the idea of “paying dues”. “Paying dues” a phrase that refers working hard with a great deal of patience, endurance and commitment to the little things in order to earn respect and an opportunity to take on a much larger or more visible role.\nWhile rapping from Nispey’s perspective on “The Heart Part 5”, Kendrick uses the phrase “paid dues” to describe the hard work that Nipsey Hussle put into the rap game by releasing 13 mixtapes in 12 years from 2005 to 2017 before releasing his only studio album in 2018.\nReflectin’ on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums By saying “I paid your dues”, Kendrick would seem to be talking to someone who did not work hard to earn respect. This could be a reference to Drake, whom Kendrick has repeatedly criticized for using ghostwriters to write his rap lyrics instead of putting in the work to write his own lyrics.\nSimilarly , on “euphoria” and “meet the grahams”, Kendrick criticized Drake for receiving Ozempic weight loss injection, having abdominal surgery to improve his appearance without needing to pay his dues by working out.\nYeah, my first one like my last one, it’s a classic, you don’t have one\nLet your core audience stomach that, then tell ’em where you get your abs from\n-“euphoria”\nEven if it don’t benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline\nDon’t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did\nDon’t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership\n-“meet the grahams” By saying “paid your dues”, Kendrick could also be saying that Drake never did the hard, therapeutic work of self-examination to understand how he needs to grow and mature. This lack of self-examination left Kendrick to do the examination work for Drake, which resulted in the astute criticisms that Kendrick made throughout all the battle tracks.\nAnd so it’s up, if you ain’t one of ours, it’s bad news It’s up “And so it’s up, if you ain’t one of ours, it’s bad news” \u003e Ain’t one of ours By saying “it’s up”, Kendrick could be indicating that the “time is up”, which would connect back to the first line of each verse which said “It’s time to watch the party die”.\nKendrick asserts that the death of “the party” will be bad news to those who “ain’t one of ours”.\nUsing the phrase “ain’t one of ours” to refer to people outside of the community or outside of the circle of trust mirrors the core mesage of the battle track “Not Like Us” where Kendrick mentions Drake and the members of Drake’s crew by name prior to the chorus where Kenrick repeatedly said “They not like us.” My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up Jay Estrada fitness “My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up” \u003e Jay Estrada fitness Kendrick’s hometown friend, Jay (or Jason) Estrada is Compton-native athletic fitness trainer who worked as a strength trainer for the 2016 U.S.A. Olympic basketball teams. Additionally, Jay Estrada has also trained other NBA players including Compton-native DeMar Derozan, who made a guest appearance in the “Not Like Us” video after Kendrick name dropped him in the second verse of “Not Like Us”.\nBy working out with Jay Estrada, Kendrick is again showing himself to be someone who pays his own dues in contrast to Drake who allegedly paid for for the shortcut of Ozempic and abdominal surgery based on Kendrick’s words to Drake’s son on “meet the grahams”.\nEven if it don’t benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline\nDon’t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did\nDon’t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership It is notable, that Kendrick’s advice to Drake’s son to “do some push-ups” is a direct response to “Push Ups”, Drake’s initial diss track where Drake mocked Kendrick for a viral social media video which shoed Kendrick doing push-ups in a park. Drake used the image of Kendrick doing push-ups as a metaphor for Kendrick getting coerced into a disadvantageous financial situation by Top Dawg, the Black owner of Kendrick’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Drake asserted that every time Top Dawg told Kendrick to “drop” (i.e. drop to the ground as a metaphor for dropping an album), Kendrick had to give Top Dawg “fifty” (i.e. fifty push ups as a metaphor for 50% of the royalties from Kedrick’s music releases).\nExtortion baby, whole career, you been shook up\n‘Cause Top told you, “Drop and give me fifty,” like some push-ups, huh\n…\nPull your contract ‘cause we gotta see the split\nThe way you doin’ splits, bitch, your pants might rip\nYou better do that motherfuckin’ show inside the bity\nMaroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty\nThen we need a verse for the Swifties\nTop say drop, you better drop and give ’em fifty\n…\nAyy, better drop and give me fifty, ayy\nDrop and give me fifty, drop and give me fifty, ayy From Kendrick’s perspective, by choosing to mock Kendrick for doing push up exercise and working hard for Top Dawg, Drake is exposing himself as someone who would rather cheat and sell himself to the White owned entertainment industry instead of working hard to pay his dues. In Katt William’s viral Club Shay Shay interview that Kendrick alluded to on “meet the grahams”, Katt Wiliams made the exact same point against comics and entertainers who sold out to the White owned entertainment industry used ghostwriters and did not pay their dues or otherwise gave up on working hard. Katt Williams compared these people to athletes or body builders who use performance enhancing drugs to avoid putting in the hard work of exercising but still want people to impressed with their bodies.\nI’m a standup comedian. This is my nineteenth one-hundred city tour. I’m not going to have a conversation with these lazy bums that’ll take a shortcut at any point. Yes, it’s easier for you to juice than to get in the gym, but you don’t get to bring that body in here talking crazy talk about how good you look. Burn it down to build it up “My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up” \u003e Burn it down to build it up “You gotta burn it down to build it up” would seem to be a statement that Jay Estrada would make in the context of strength and fitness training.\nIn order to build stronger muscles, an athlete first has to break down the existing muscle by lifting, pressing or pulling weights or some other kind of resistance. These kinds of exercises create tiny microtears in muscle fibers that are accompanied by a burning sensation in the muscles. This burning sensation is what is being referred to by the exercise term “feel the burn”.\nThe idea of “burn it down to build it up” could be applied to much of the violent language that Kendrick has used when acting like a totalitarian dictator who is trying to purge society and “burn the whole village” so “we can start over” with the hope of building a “new earth”.\nAt the same time, if we see Kendrick’s fierce criticism and exposure of Drake as a way to “burn it down to build it up”, the natural conclusion is that Kendrick actually wants Drake to be built up into a better person.\nThis act of “tough love” is consistent with Kendrick’s words on “meet the grahams” where he explained his motives for engaging in a rap battle with Drake.\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin’ I wanted to crash your party\nBut truthfully, I don’t have a hatin’ bone in my body\n…\nThirty-seven, but you showin’ up as a seven-year-old\nYou got gamblin’ problems, drinkin’ problems, pill-poppin’ and spendin’ problems\nBad with money, whorehouse\nSolicitin’ women problems, therapy’s a lovely start\nBut I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom\nI try to empathize with you ‘cause I know that you ain’t been through nothin’\nCrave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it’s puzzlin’\nNo dominance, let’s recap moments when you didn’t fit in\nNo secret handshakes with your friend\nNo culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin’ your mother\nIdentity’s on the fence, don’t know which family will love ya\nThe skin that you livin’ in is compromised in personas\nCan’t channel your masculine even when standin’ next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon’ hide them baby mamas, ain’t ya?\nYou embarrassed of ’em, that’s not right, that ain’t how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside Trust “Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside” \u003e Trust The phrase “locked in” is most often used to describe someone who is focused on their goal, which connects to the themes of paying dues and working out in the previous lines. Here Kendrick says he is focused on (i.e. locked in to) “what he trusts”.\nIt is notable that Kendrick’s rap battle with Drake started when Kendrick was featured on the song “Like That” on Future and Metro Boomin’s album titled, We Don’t Trust You. That album title seems to have been a statement about Drake, who the two Atlanta-native artists had previously worked with but no longer trusted.\nThroughout the battle, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being an actor, manipulator and liar who cannot be trusted.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now spiralin’\nYou’re movin’ just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin’ distasteful\nI calculate you’re not as calculated, I can even predict your angle\nFabricating stories on the family front ‘cause you heard Mr. Morale\nA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now\nYou’re not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\nTommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection\nI make music that electrify ’em, you make music that pacify ’em\nI can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that’s random acts of kindness\nKnow you a master manipulator and habitual liar too\nBut don’t tell no lie about me and I won’t tell truths ‘bout you\n-“euphoria”\nI think somebody lyin’\nSmell somebody lyin’\nI don’t see no fire\n…\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I could see the vibes on Ak’\n-“6:16 in LA”\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\n-“meet the grahams”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\n…\nThe settlers was usin’ townfolk to make ’em richer\nFast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\n-“Not Like Us” Outside “Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside” \u003e Outside Since Kendrick does trust Drake he looks “outside” to find what he does trust. Here “outside” seems to refer to the world around Kendrick, or maybe more specifically the city around him—the city of Compton.\nThe association with the city of Compton being “outside” seems to be highlighted on “Not Like Us” where in quick succession Kendrick mentions Drake—the liar and false god, who need to be locked inside (a jail cell)—in contrast to the city that is free to be outside.\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\nFreaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy\nRoll they ass up like a fresh pack of ‘za, ayy\nCity is back up, it’s a must, we outside, ayy The music video of “Not Like Us” further emphisizes the contrast between the city of Compton being free outside with numerous shots of large crowds filling the plaza of the Compton City Hall and Civic Center while Drake’s OVO owl is locked up inside a birdcage. Notably, the owl in the birdcage is shown in the second to last shot right before the video cuts back a final shot of the large crowd dancing at the Compton City Hall and Civic Center under a sculture dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr..\nThe kids live tomorrow ‘cause today, the party just died Kids “The kids live tomorrow ‘cause today, the party just died” \u003e Kids Kendrick ends that song by declaring that at some point between the beginning and end of this song, Kendrick has watched the party die, likely as a result of Kendrick’s execution orders.\nIn contrast to the party—which will not go on tomorrow—,Kendrick highlights the kids who are now able to live tomorrow.\nThe mention of kids is likely a reference to Kendrick’s allegation that Drake and his crew were trafficking underaged girls to for Drake and his crew to have sex with at parities. At the same time, uncompromising artists such as Katt Williams has sought to expose that powerful men engaging in predatory sexual behavior is a widespread, endemic problem throughout the entertainment industry.\nThe future for kids has been a central focus for Kendrick since he became a father as can be seen throughout Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper’s theme of breaking generational curses - particularly curses that related to sexual abuse.\nPlayin’ “Baby Shark” with my daughter\nWatchin’ for sharks outside at the same time\nLife as a protective father, I’d kill for her\nMy son Enoch is the part two\nWhen I expire, my children’ll make higher valleys\nIn this present moment, I saw that through\n-“Worldwide Steppers”\nEnoch, your father’s just detoxed, my callin’ is right on time\n…\nUzi, your father’s in deep meditation\nMy spirit’s awakened, my brain is asleep\n-“Mr. Morale”\nFamily ties, they accused my cousin, “Did he touch you, Kendrick?”\nNever lied, but no one believed me when I said “He didn’t”\n…\n“Did he touch you?” I said “No” again, still they didn’t believe me\n…\nI asked my momma why she didn’t believe me when I told her “No”\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I’m sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn’t agree\nNow I’m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver ‘cause I’m nervous\n…\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract\nA conversation not bein’ addressed in Black families\nThe devastation, hauntin’ generations and humanity\nThey raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters\nThen they made us watch, then made us rape each other\nPsychotic torture between our lives, we ain’t recovered\nStill livin’ as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance\nEvery other brother has been compromised\nI know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused\nI see ’em daily buryin’ they pain in chains and tattoos\nSo listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move\nLearn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school\nHis anger grows deep in misogyny\nThis is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active\nSo I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made\nSo I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame\nSo I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother’s pain\nI hope Hykeem made you proud ‘cause you ain’t die in vain\nSo I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all\nSo I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God\nSo I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred\nAs I set free all you abusers, this is transformation\n… [Whitney Alford]\nYou did it, I’m proud of you\nYou broke a generational curse\nSay “Thank you, dad”\nThank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother\n-“Mother I Sober” “Die for the Party” by Lecrae [Verse] I was wrestlin’ like, should I write a verse? Should I write a verse? “I was wrestlin’ like, should I write a verse?” \u003e Should I write a verse? Lecrae’s track “Die for the Party” features the exact same beat as Kendrick Lamar’s “Watch the Party Die”. As Lecrae mentions here, “Die for the Party” is meant to serve as an additional verse for “Watch the Party Die”.\nLecrae decided to release this verse on his own rather than Kendrick inviting him to do so as part of a remix or extended version. That being said, on two separate lines within the third verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick did say that he wondered “what Lecrae would do”.\nSometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?\n…\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do Lecrae thus seems to have reasonably concluded that those two lines from “Watch the Party Die” were an open invitation for him to write and release his verse on “Die for the Party”.\nThe culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here Culture vultures “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Culture vultures Lecrae here makes a reference to the Jay-Z’s classic and often quoted lines from the 2001 track “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” where Kendricks challenges the status quo of the music industry.\nI do this for my culture, to let ’em know\nWhat a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster\nShow ’em how to move in a room full of vultures\nIndustry shady, it need to be taken over\nLabel owners hate me, I’m raisin’ the status quo up\nI’m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush\nPay us like you owe us for \u0026\u0026all the years that you hoed us*\nWe can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks* Recall that on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick also makes a subtle reference to these exact lines from “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)”.\nSay hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores\nYou let ’em snack, they eat your face, the signatures is bein’ forged Clout chasing “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Clout chasing In slang, the phrase “clout-chasing” is used to describe a person who seeks attention, fame, or influence, often by engaging in behavior that attracts public interest or aligns that themself with popular trends or influential figures.\nIn many cases, rappers are accused of “clout-chasing” when they directly name more famous hip hop artists in order to associate themselves with more famous artist without actually being invited to collaborate with the such famous artist.\n“Clout chasers” can be seen as a form of “culture vulture” since “clout chasers” are metaphorically scavenging off of someone else who has been “killing it” rather than using their own skills, discipline or hard work to eat what they kill. Thus, “clout chasing” is also a way for someone to avoid “paying dues” or working hard, as Kendrick mentioned in the first verse.\nIt is notable that on the battle track “THE HEART PART 6”, Drake accused Kendrick of “clout chasing” as Drake denied Kendrick’s allegations that Drake was involved in pedophilia and sex trafficing.\nAlbum droppin’ soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser ‘stead of doin’ hard labor tryna prove they worth Prove their worth “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Prove their worth Lecrae suggests that “culture vulture” rappers turn to “clout-chasing” in order to “prove their worth”. This psychological need to prove one’s own worth through success as a rapper is a vice with which Lecrae has personally struggled even as he is learning to find his identity in who God made him to be.\nDuring Lecrae’s own The Deep End podcast episode where he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake, Lecrae concluded that the main problem with the battle was that both rappers were trying to tear down their rival in order to obtain a false sense of value and worth.\nIt becomes a problem when your identity is on the line a war trying to tear down someone’s identity it’s not me trying to best you to show you you’re fake and I’m real it’s not me trying to best you to show you that I’m superior to you and that is the ultimate problem with finding our worth in what we do. What we tend to do is find the quality of our work as the quality of our worth and I think that’s a lot of what we’re seeing between these guys which I think is so unhealthy because at the end of the day you’re in order to be great you’ve got to have someone less than you—that you got to have someone to step on in order for you to have value and worth. If we’re talking about the quality of our work—if your identity is shaped by what you do and being the best at it, then you got to step on someone else to prove that you are worthy of whatever it is you say you are.\nSo, at the end of the day, I think the real battle is between whenever you make anything like your ability or your body or your looks a part of your identity, they’ll ultimately begin to crush you. Those things are going to crush you because they’ve got to always measure up. When they don’t measure up, now your identity and your value are worthless.\nSo I wouldn’t be surprised if internally Drake is feeling a sense of worthlessness … I wouldn’t be surprised if he has to go look at the things he’s done to remind himself of his worth.\nI remember when I was in high school, and in high school, my value was being the dope rapper. … And here comes Steve from Brooklyn. He’s kicking metaphors and similes and bars and references. I was just destroyed. And because of that, my value was now in question. My identity, my worth, was in question.\nSo what did I do? I had two choices: I could either run away from him so that I could maintain some semblance of value, or I could associate with him so I could regain some sense of value.\nNow, the good news is, I became a better rapper. The bad news is that all it did was reignite a false sense of self-worth and identity, to where, fast forward, I’m writing a song about identity because I’m still wrestling with that reality.\nAnd God already told me I mattered. He told me in scripture. I mean, the creator of creation Himself knows me by name, and I’m still fighting. I’m still fighting for a false sense of identity. They need attention\nThey can't imagine me not tryna make myself look bigger\noff of this Kendrick mention Lecrae’s intention “They need attention. They can’t imagine me not tryna make myself look bigger” \u003e Lecrae’s intention Lecrae continues to explain how “clout-cashing culture vultures” need attention from other people in order to prove their own worth and have a sense of identity.\nLecrae concludes that people who are themselves so consumed with the need to prove their worth and get attention would naturally assume that other people around them are also trying to do the same thing. Such people might jealously assume that Lecrase is “clout-chasing” and trying to make himself look more important by using Kendrick’s mention of Lecrae in “Watch the Party Die” as an excuse to verse that associates himself with Kendrick. I can’t imagine his position Can’t imagine “I can’t imagine his position” \u003e Can’t imagine Lecras seems to be empathizing with Kendrick as Lecrae recognizes how difficult it must be for Kendrick to be at the top of the rap game.\nRecall that on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick said “The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried”.\nWhile Kendrick did wonder what Lecrae would do if Lecrae was in Kendrick’s position, Lecrae recognizes that his own trials, while certainly challenging, really don’t compare to what Kendrick must face as arguably the most visible hip hop artist in the world. Hence, Lecrae seems to humbly recognize that he really cannot know for sure what he would actually do since he can’t even imagine being in such a position. Before I got on my mission, I was a party victim Mission “Before I got on my mission, I was a party victim” \u003e Mission The word “mission” in the most general sense can be defined as ”a set of tasks that fulfills a purpose”. The word also tends to imply that the person will need to leave their home and go to a different land, nation or people group in order to fulfill their purpose (e.g. a diplomatic mission or spy mission).\nWithin this history of Western culture, the word “mission” has most often been used to refer to efforts made by a church or an individual Christian who goes to a foreign country in order to introduce Jesus’s life and teachings to people from that country using language and references that the people can understand within their own cultural context.\nAs rappers who became Christians later in their teenage years of early 20s, Lecrae and Kendrick both came to the conclusion that God had sent them on a mission to introduce Jesus’s life and teachings to members of the Black community in America using language and references that Black Americans could understand within their own cultural context.\nAs a Christian hip hop artist, Lecrase has been very clear and overt about his mission throughout all of his albums. In contrast, Kendrick has not usually been so overt. Most of his albums do have an overarching storyline that communicates central Christian understanding about Jesus and living a Christian life. However, listeners usually have to pay more attention to notice these overarching messages.\nHowever, on the 2009 track “Faith” from Kendrick’s first project released under the stage name Kendrick Lamar, Kendrick openly discussed the moment when he talked to God and accepted his mission.\nI found myself losing focus at a Sunday service\nEmbarrassed so I start questioning God, “What is my purpose?”\nHe said to live the way he did, that’s all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian\nAnd this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can’t help but give in\nI’m giving testimonies to strangers I never met\nHopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed Party victim “Before I got on my mission, I was a party victim” \u003e Party victim Lecrae builds off the “party” metaphor by saying that he was a “party victim”. At the most basic level, Lecrae seems to be reflecting on how his life prior to becoming a Christian was undisciplined in his pursuit of temporary pleasure in a way that led him to seek enjoyment in ways that ultimately led to pain and hurt.\nAt the same time, we should recall that in the analysis of the first verse of “Watch the Party Die\", “the party” could also be interpreted as a reference to acts of sexual abuse particularly abuse of underage girls and boys.\nIt is thus notable that on the track “Good, Bad, Ugly”, Lecrae discussed the trauma he experienced after being a victim of sexual abuse by a baby sitter who performed a sex act on him when he seven years old.\nFolks workin’ late I had a baby sitter\nI ain’t ‘bout to sit here and name her\nI was almost 8 when she came in late\nWoke me up with a game to play\nDid a few things that’s hard to say\nAnd told me to keep that secret safe\nNow how a young boy supposed to deal\nI’m tryna act like it ain’t real\nHad my innocence just stripped from me\nAnd I still don’t know how to feel Lecrae’s traumatic experience seems to align with Kendrick’s own assessment that “ever other rapper” he knows has been sexually abused and continues to go unaddresed in many Black families which leads many Black people to live as “victims” as Kendrick discussed on the track “Mother I Sober” from *Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers\".\nFamily ties, they accused my cousin, “Did he touch you, Kendrick?”\nNever lied, but no one believed me when I said “He didn’t”\n…\n“Did he touch you?” I said “No” again, still they didn’t believe me\n…\nI asked my momma why she didn’t believe me when I told her “No”\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I’m sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn’t agree\nNow I’m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver ‘cause I’m nervous\n…\nA conversation not bein’ addressed in Black families\nThe devastation, hauntin’ generations and humanity\nThey raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters\nThen they made us watch, then made us rape each other\nPsychotic torture between our lives, we ain’t recovered\nStill livin’ as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance\nEvery other brother has been compromised\nI know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused\nI see ’em daily buryin’ they pain in chains and tattoos\nSo listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move\nLearn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school\nHis anger grows deep in misogyny\nThis is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active I brought the party favors Party favors “I brought the party favors” \u003e Party favors After telling us that he was a “party victim”, Lecrae then says that he “brought the party favors”.\n“Party favors” are gifts that a party host gives to the party attendees to thank them for coming. This transition seems to suggest that Lecrae went from someone who was forced to be an unwilling participant of “the party” to someone who not only attended and willingly participated but seemingly organized and hosted\" the party\".\nAt the most basic level, Lecrae seems to be saying that as someone who became successful in the entertainment industry, he was at the center of groups of people who were also undisciplined in their pursuit of temporary pleasure.\nAt the same time, if we take into account Lecrae’s history of being sexually abused, one could also interpret the line to be a reflection of how Lecrae’s trauma from sexual abuse led him to later to engage in sexual behavior that—while maybe not criminal—was not healthy or loving for himself or for those with whome he was sexually involved.\nFittingly, on the same verse of “Good, Bad, Ugly” where Lecrae revealed that he had been sexually abused, Lecrae talked about the connection between his early sexual trauma of and the sexual misbehavior that he engaged in later in life. This sexual misbehavior continued until Lecrae forgave his abuser, received forgiveness and got on his mission.\nAnd I wonder how to address it\nCan’t tell my family too messy\nSo I just embrace it it’s hard to face it\nI’m too ashamed to confess it\nSo I kept it in and ain’t speak\nDidn’t think it hit me so deep\nSo into it I got promiscuous\nAnd only God could help me get free\nBut I been forgiven\nMy Savior risen\nI’m out the prison\nI know that (I know that)\nI got the power to say to no to all of my struggles\nGod will control that (yeah)\nEvery time we slip and we fall\nGotta get back up and fight on\nWe are not defined by our past\nThe future look bright\nI see the light on It is notable that on “Mother I Sober”, Kendrick also wrestled with his own sexual misbehavior and addiction which he saw as one of the effects of the unresolved generation trauma from sexual abuse.\nIntoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\nI asked my momma why she didn’t believe me when I told her “No”\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I’m sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn’t agree\nNow I’m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver ‘cause I’m nervous I used my trauma, my single mama, to justify commas Trauma “I used my trauma, my single mama, to justify commas” \u003e Trauma After acknowledging that he was a “party victim” who later “brought the party favor”, Lecrae goes on to explain that he had money to buy the party favors after he used his own trauma—including the trauma of growing up without a father and being a “party victim”—as a justification for having an unhealthy focus on wealth.\nHere “commas” refers to a large amount of money that needs a comma to separate the hundreds digit from thousands digit and the ten thousands digit from the millions digit.\nThrougout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers Kendrick also talked about the unhealthy pattern of hip hop artists trying to profit by making music about their trauma.\nSo what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us\nI bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once\nI bought infinity pools I never swimmed in\nI watched Keem buy four cars in four months\nYou know the family dynamics on repeat\nThe insecurities locked down on PC\nI bought a .223, nobody peace treat\nYou won’t doo-doo me, I smell TNT\n\u0026\u0026Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche\nPaid lottery for it*, I ain’t want it in portions\nPoverty was the case\nBut the money wipin’ the tears away*\n-“United In Grief” Rich nigga, gettin’ my dick sucked after the show\nI ain’t gon’ lie, we were poor\nA bunch of lost souls in survival mode\nIt wasn’t no way for us unless we found our own\nRunnin’ in stores, kickin’ in doors, nigga, give me my glory\nNigga play with me, he ain’t gon’ live to tell the story\nYou know, this the type of shit we glorify, everybody gang-gang\nMost of the people that you grew up with are now in the chain gang\nIn the box, gettin’ pink\n“Rich (Interlude)”\nMy mother’s mother followed me for years in her afterlife\nStarin’ at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night\nLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover\nTransformation, you ain’t felt grief ’til you felt it sober\n-“Mother I Sober”\nGirl, I’m not relevant to givin’ on profit\nPersonal gain off my pain, it’s nonsense\n-“Mirror”\nto pay the devil’s wages, woo, huh Devil’s wages “to pay the devil’s wages, woo, huh” \u003e Devil’s wages Lecrae describes the large amounts of money as the “devil’s wages”. The use of the word “devil” connects to the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick rapped.\nIt’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword\nWe settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce It’s also notable that in St. Paul’s letter to the Church in Rome, St. Paul says “The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” The idea that the wages of the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”] are closely associated with death also connects to the titles of “Watch the Party Die” and “Die for the Party”.\nThat probably went over they heads\nBasically what I said is I was government fed\nBred for doin’ time in the feds, but Jesus bled Went over their heads “That probably went over they heads” \u003e Went over their heads The phrase “went over their head” refers to a situation in which a speaker says something that the listener does not understand, usually because what the speaker said was too complex or because the listener is not refined or thoughtful enough to understand.\nOn the surface it seems that Lecrae is saying that many of his listeners will probably not understand all the terminology or references in the previous lines.\nAt the same time, Lecrae is also recycling lines from “Always Knew”, the opening track to Lecrae’s 2017 album, All Things Work Together.\nI know this might go over some heads\nBut I come from being government fed\nCould be running from feds\nBut now I give the government bread\n‘Cause you playin’ back the words that I said* Here on “Die for the Party”, Lecrae essentially flips those lines to from “Always Knew” by using many of the same words but slightly tweaking their presentation or meaning.\nGovernment fed “Basically what I said is I was government fed” \u003e Government fed On both “Die for the Party” and “Always Knew”, being “government fed”, refers to a state of poverty in which the parents of a family do not make enough money to feed the family and thus rely on the government to provide a significant amount of the family’s food.\nIn the United States, food was may be provided in the form of monetary assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (aka food stamps) or direct distribution of food items though the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which provides things like canned meat, canned vegetables, rice pasta, and cheese that has commonly been referred to as “government cheese”. Bred for doin’ time in the feds “Bred for doin’ time in the feds, but Jesus bled” \u003e Bred for doin’ time in the feds In the phrase “bred for doing time in the feds”, bred is the past tense of “breed” referring to the way that genetics and environment or experience influences reproduction and the traits of subsequent generations.\n“Bred” is also used as a double entendre to refer to the homophone food item “bread” (i.e. a loaf of bread) which is something that Lecrae’s family or other families in poverty may purchased with SNAP benefits when they were “government fed”.\nMoreover, we find a triple entendre when we recognize that the food item “bread” is also used as slang for money, as it used in “Always Knew” where Lecrae talks about giving “the government bread” in reference to paying taxes on the money that he has earned as a grammy0winning Christian hip hop artist.\nHowever, prior to being a grammy winning Christian hip hop artist, Lecrae was “bred” (i.e. born and raised) in an environment where men and women would often try to get “bread” (both money and food) by committing federal crimes such as selling drugs, gang-banging, robberies, or scamming.\nIn hip hop terminology, the word “federal” is often shortened to “fed” or “feds” which makes it a homophone for the word “fed” (i.e. the past tense of “feed”). On “Always Knew” Lecrae used the terms “government fed” and “running from the feds” as double entendre to refer peoplw who rely on food benefits from the federal government while simultaneously trying to evade arrest from federal agents after committing a federal crime.\nHere in “Die for the Party”, Lecrae says that he was bred (i.e. born and raised) to do “time in the fed” which refers to time spent in a federal penitentiary or prison after being convicted and sentences for a federal crime.\nThe point here seems to be that based on the long history of slavery, sexual abuse, segregation, lack of education, racial inequality, poverty and other forms of generation trauma, the genetics and the environment that Lecrae received from his parents made Lecrae statistically more likely to commit federal crimes and be sentenced to time in the federal prison as punishment for his crimes. Jesus bled “Bred for doin’ time in the feds, but Jesus bled” \u003e Jesus bled After describing himself as being “bred for doin’ time in the feds”, Lecrae then says “Jesus bled”. Here “Jesus bled” is a reference to the scene in all four Gospel accounts in which Jesus’s blood spilled out of his body when Roman soldiers whipped Jesus, forced a crown of thorns onto Jesu’s head, and hammered nails through Jesus’s hands and feet to attach him to the wooden beams of an execution cross.\nIt is notable that Lecrae uses the word “but” between “bred for doin time in the feds” and “Jesus bled”, which seems to imply a contrast. In particular, the punishment of a federal prison sentence that guilty people receive for committing federal crimes is contrasted with the punishment of beatings, whipping, torture, and crucifixion that an innocent Jesus received for a crime that he did not commit. Moreover, all four Gospel accounts make it clear that as the only truly innocent man, Jesus died on behalf of and in place of those who were actually guilty.\nThis idea of an innocent Jesus being executed in place of the guilty is most clearly highlighted in a scene in which the Judeans who were jealous of Jesus asked the Roman governor to free a criminal who was convicted of murderer and leading of an armed revolt and to crucify Jesus in place of this criminal.\nNow at the Passover feast the Roman governor was accustomed to release to the crown one prisoner whom they desired. At the time, they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas (one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder). When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”\nNow the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. But the Roman governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”\nThey said, “Barabbas!”\nPilate, the Roman governor, said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?”\nThey all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”\nBut the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?\nBut they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”\nSo when Pilate, the Roman governor, saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crown, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”\nAll the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!”\nThen he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he whipped and delivered to be crucified.\n-Matthew 27:15-26 Additionally, as we already pointed out, the word “bred” (i.e. past tense of “breed”) is a homophone with the food item “bread” and also rhymes with “bled”. In another famous scene that is often referred to as the “Last Supper” or “Lord’s Supper”, Jesus shares broken pieces of bread and a cup of wine with his disciples and declares that the broken bread is actually Jesus’s body which is broken during Jesus’s crucifixion and the wine is actually Jesus’s blood which is shed during Jesus’s crucifixion. By giving his disciples his body and blood to eat and drink, Jesus promises to use this meal to help the disciples find freedom from their sins and transform the disciple to be more like Jesus.\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks (Greek: eucharisteō) for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”\nHe took the cup of wine, gave thanks (Greek: eucharisteō), and gave to them, saying, “All of you drink it, for this is my blood of the new agreement, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness and freedom from sins. -Matthew 26:26-28 This “Last Supper” or “Lord’s Supper” was later instituted as a Christian ritual called “communion” referring to the idea of the church community forming a union with God. The ritual is alternatively known as the “eucharist” referring to the Greek word for “give thanks”. For most of church history, communion / the eucharist has been the central component of church services and of Christian life as a whole.\nHence, we now recognize that the word “bred” is actually a quadruple entendre which refers to:\n“Bred” as in breeding offspring “Bread” as in a loaf of bread “Bread” as in money “Bread” as in Jesus’s body This quadruple entendre probably went over almost everyone’s head\nInstead of puttin’ dents in they head, He turned His subsection “Instead of puttin’ dents in they head, He turned His” \u003e Putting dents in their heads “Put a dent in their head” is a slang phrase that is normally said by someone who is annoyed or angry with another person and wants to threaten that they will violently hurt that person by striking the person on the head.\nThis phrase “puttin’ dents in they head” mirrors the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick said “I want his head cracked before he’s back home”.\nAs Lecrae points out, unlike Kendrick and others who might want to put a dent in the heads of their enemies, Jesus turned his head. Here the phrase “turned his” is a reference to Jesus’s teaching that instead of using violence to oppose and hurt an evil person in the same way that the evil person hurt one of Jesus’s disciple, it would be better for the disciple to “turn the other cheek” when they are slapped in the face or otherwise insulted.\n“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I say to you, do not show opposition in the same way as an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek toward him also.\n-Matthew 5:38-39 Jesus exemplified his own teaching after he was arrested and one of the officers slapped Jesus on the face. The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Judeans always meet. I said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, they know the things which I said.” When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?” Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, confirm the wrong; but if I spoke rightly, why do you beat me?”\nIt is notable that when Jesus was slapped in the face he did speak against the wrong that was being done to him but he did not add another wrong to the situation but using his power to slap the officer in response. My cup runneth over with nonsense Cup runs over “My cup runneth over with nonsense” \u003e subsection The phrase “my cup runneth over” is a reference to a poem called Psalm 23 in which King David reflects on how the Lord takes care of him, provides what he needs, and keeps him safe from danger even in the “presence of his enemies.”\nYou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and loyal love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the LORD forever. -Psalm 23:4-6 In Psalm 23, King David expresses a deep trust in God’s protection which allows him to sit at a table and drink wine from a cup even while his enemies are around him. This trust in God’s protection leads David to a peaceful disposition which is a clear contrast with Kendrick who seems convinced the he must deal with his enemies himself throughout “Watch the Party Die” and throughout the battle with Drake.\nThe fact that Lecrae says his cup “runs over with nonsense” puts an interesting twist on Psalm 23. This twist seems to suggest a very different dynamic where he does not have the sense to trust the Lord in the presence of his enemies.\nThe lack of sense might be due to Lecrae being emotionally dysregulated, not being able to think clearly or making bad decisions after drinking alcohol. Lecrae has more recently quit drinking alcohol for his own health and well being, which is something that he has talked about openly in a few interviews and podcast episodes.\nGiven that Lecrae already mentioned how he used his trauma to “pay the wages”, Lecrae could also be building on this idea of using alcohol as an unhealthy way to deal with personal pain.\nThey hearts grow colder, they love to do evil\nthey burn they conscience Hearts grow cold “They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience” \u003e Hearts grow cold “The hearts grow cold” seems to be a reference to Jesus’s prophecy about a pattern of destructive circumstances in which various individuals and false prophets will misrepresent Jesus and claim to be anointed leaders while leading many people away from Jesus. Leading people away from Jesus will eventually lead to wars, betrayal, sin, lawlessness, famine, environmental devastation and eventually to the end of the world as we know it. Within such a pattern of turning from Jesus’s commandments towards chaos, Jesus said that many humans “love will grow cold”.\nJesus answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ (anointed leader),’ and will lead many astray. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.\nThen they will deliver you up to oppression and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake. Then many will stumble, and will hand one another over to the authorities, and will hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray. Because actions against the law will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. This Good News (aka Gospel) of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\n-Matthew 24:4-14 This idea of human wickedness being a sign that the end is coming is similar to Kendrick’s assessment of why it’s time for the party to end.\nI think it’s time to watch the party die\nThis shit done got too wicked to apologize Love to do evil “They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience” \u003e Love to do evil “They love to do evil” is reminiscent of Jesus’s words to one of the Judean religious leaders where he explained that although God loved the world and had sent Jesus to be the “light of the world” who would rescue people from death and give them a new kind of eternal life, not all humans would receive this eternal life. Jesus said that some humans would be condemned to death not necessarily in a direct form of Jesus condemning them, but in the indirect form of the natural consequences for preferring to do evil in the darkness rather than coming into the light where they would need to stop doing evil.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his unique and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be [saved / rescued] through him.\nThe one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has already been condemned, because that one has not believed in the name of the unique and only Son of God.\nThis is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, but humans loved the darkness rather than the light; because their works were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, unless his actions would be exposed. But the one who does what is true comes to the light, that his actions may be revealed, that they have been done in God.\n-John 3:16-21 Burn their conscience “They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience” \u003e Burn their conscience “They burn their conscience” is a reference to St. Paul’s first letter to Timothy, where St. Paul also talks about the pattern leading to the end of the world as we know it. St. Paul says that some people will turn away from Jesus’s teaching and instead listen to the teaching of “deceitful spirits”, “demons”, “liars” and “hypocrites.” St. Paul suggests that these liars and hypocrites can be identified by the fact that they have burned a brand mark into their own conscience which shows that they are owned by the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].\nThe Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, under the influence of liars and hypocrites who have burned their own conscience as with a branding iron.\n-1 Timothy 4:1-2 I want the dealer’s head who gave my cousin fentanyl Fentanyl “I want the dealer’s head who gave my cousin fentanyl” \u003e Fentanyl After talking about cold-hearted liars and hypocrites who love to do evil, Lecrae seems to give us an example of one such person: the drug dealer who sold fentanyl to Lecrae’s cousin\nFentanyl is a powerful, unnatural, man-made opioid that was initially used in the 1990s to relieve pain for patrons with severe pain, such as cancer. However, in the 2000s fentanyl began to be used illegally as a recreational drug. The recreational form of fentanyl is often mixed with other hard drugs like heroin or cocaine—often without the user’s knowledge—which made it very likely to make users overdose even with small amounts of fentanyl.\nFentanyl overdoses became an epidemic after illegal, irresponsible and greedy actions by some pharmaceutical companies and doctors led to a sharp increase in the number of opioid addictions throughout North America.\nGangs in Mexico exploited this widespread increase in additions, importanting chemical precursors from China, producing fentanyl cheaply in Mexico and then smuggling fentanyl laced pills across the border into America.\nBy the mid 2010s, many of these fentanyl laced pills ended up in the hands of teenagers who bought what they thought they were buying prescription pills such as oxycodone/percocets, xanax, adderall, or vicodin but ended up ingesting lethal doses of fentanyl.\nIn many cases, teenagers bought these fentanyl laced pills through social media apps, particularly snapchat which offered the useful feature of disappearing messages.\nThe details of the fentanyl epidemic highlight how a pursuit of person profit or national gross domestic profit by stock market investors, drug dealers, gangs, pharmaceutical corporations, tech companies and governments can inspire killers to adopt evil, wicked business practices which lead to increased addictions and deaths of countless men, women and children, including Lecrae’s cousin. Want the dealer’s head “I want the dealer’s head who gave my cousin fentanyl” \u003e Want the dealer’s head The wicked choices that allowed Lecrae’s cousin to take fentanyl leads Lecrae to say “I want the dealer’s head”. This statement seems to apply that somewhere inside his heart, Lecreae would like the dealer to be murdered, maybe even decapitated so the head can be brought back to Lecrae for inspection.\nThis line directly mirror Kendrick’s line from the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick said:\nIf I’m not his vote\nThen you need to bring his fuckin’ head, or film that shit in hi-res Given that Lecrae has been a Chrisitan hip hop artists for almost two decades, it might be surprising to hear him express this desire to take revenge for his cousin through a vicious murder.\nHowever, this honest confession highlights the fact that even after “getting on his mission” Lecrae still faces spiritual, mental, and emotional tests which causes him to wrestle with faith and really decide if he wants to follow Jesus’s teachings and example. Lecrae’s honest wrestling is likely one of the main reasons that Kendrick wanted to know “what Lecrae would do”.\nLabels exploitin’ rappin’ addicts, man, I’m sick of y’all Rappin’ addicts “Labels exploitin’ rappin’ addicts, man, I’m sick of y’all” \u003e Rappin’ addicts Having just highlighted gangs who profit by exploiting individuals who are addicted to opioids, Lecrae now compares those gangs to music labels who profit from exploiting listeners and rappers who are addicted to hip hop.\nThis comparison between selling addictive drugs and selling addictive music is a longstanding motif within hip hop lyrics.\nNew York based rap legend Nas largely introduced the motif a single line from the second verse of the track “Represent” from his classic debut album Illmatic released on April 19, 1994.\nSomehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game Exactly one week after the release of “Represent”, on April 26, 1994 the legendary Atlanta-based duo Outkast released their classic debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, whose first full track “Myintrotoletuknow” featured a verse from Andre who further developed the motif.\nSee, that rap shit is really just like sellin’ smoke\nIf you got some fire shit, your niggas gonna always toke\nDope is not what I be slingin’ on this track* Jay-Z then turned the motif into an extended metaphor on an entire song called “Rap Game / Crack Game” which was released on Jay-Z’s 1997 album, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Notably, the hook for “Rap Game / Crack Game” samples both “Represent” and “Myintrotoletuknow”.\nWon’t stop niggas\n“Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game”\nJigga! Feel me!\nPa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya\n“See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke”\nUhh, Roc-A-Fella\n…\nWe treat this rap shit just like, handlin’ weight\nWhat they want we give it to ’em, what they abandon we take\nHit a rapper with consignment, let him know it’s at stake\nPut his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake\nWhen it’s hot, get on my money spot in every state\nLike the Wiz and Camelot, the mom-and-pop’s is the gate\nBut first we scope shit, advertise in every area\nLet the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit\nGon’ need a middle man, so we look to radio\nLet ’em test the product, give ’em a promo show\nJust a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe\nThen we drop a maxi single and charge ’em two for five\nAin’t tryin’ to, kill ’em at first just, buildin’ clientele\nSo when the album drops the first weeks it’s on sale\nBut when demand grows it’s time to expand yo\nYou don’t want no garbage papi, it’s ten grand per blow, fo’ sho’\n…\nI got that uncut raw to make a fiend’s body jerk\nGot your whole block now, pumpin’ my work\nMy CD’s is like keys for you Willie’s who\nLike to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two’s\nAnd my singles like gems, you know the treys\nGet you high for a while, but the, high don’t stay\nYou need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks\n‘Cause when this shit flip, I’ma get on some other shit\nNever pitchin’ for a label, Jigga’s the hook-up\nYou know my shit is fishscale, y’all niggas is cook up\nJust blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota\nThey know my shit stretch without the bakin’ soda\nWent from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key\nPriority’s work wasn’t right so I switched factories\nNow I’m the new nigga, who figured I’d get the game locked\nNow watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa Drake even referenced “Rap Game / Crack Game” when he was rapping about a former girlfriend and acting like a “street nigga” on the 2013 track “Come Thru” on Nothing Was the Same.\nSomeone put a order in for a chicken\nTold my girl to order in, I need the kitchen\nYeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up\nBaby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?\nRap game, crack game, ain’t that different, ya know?\nLast album had it boomin’ somethin’ vicious, ya know?\nAnd ya know I need ya back in my life The idea of corporate guys from the entertainment industry using hip hop music like an addictive substance is also something that Kendrick alluded to on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick rapped\nIt’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified\nThe end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies Much like Kendrick, Lecrae criticizes the music industry—particularly record labels—for exploiting youth who feel they can’t live without hip hop music. These labels obtain precursor materials from Black artists coming out of poor, urban areas, who then produce music that “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” and may ultimately lead young people to make choices that lead them directly to a federal prison cell or a casket.\nLecrae also seems to acknowledge that we can’t fully blame hip hop addicts for their choices because addiction is a sickness. This acknowledgement leads Lecrae to tell the music labels, “I’m sick of y’all”.\nMy daddy ran with Compton Crips, my uncle's Piru\nStuck in the middle of this madness, what should I choose? Pirus and Crips “My daddy ran with Compton Crips, my uncle’s Piru” \u003e Pirus and Crips Here, Lecrae notes that his father was a member of the Compton Crips gang and his uncle was a member of the Pirus gang. Although Lecrae never met his father, knowing that the men in his family chose to be affiliated with gangs still had a deep influence on Lecrae as he was growing up with a single mother in a poor, urban Black neighborhood.\nOnce Lecrae became a teenager he faced his own choice about whether to follow in the footsteps of his absent father or uncle and join the Crips or the Pirus— or whether he take a totally different path.\nIt is notable that Kendrick specifically mentioned the Compton Crips and Pirus when he detailed Compton’s violent environment on the track “m.A.A.d city” from Kendrick’s classic debut album.\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey’d probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I’m in the street, I hear—\nYawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!* Moverover, Lecrae by saying that he is “stuck in the middle of this madness” Lecrae might be making another subtly allusion to the “m.A.A.d. City” of Compton, California.\nI should be choosin’ between Howard and Hampton Howard and Hampton “I should be choosin’ between Howard and Hampton” \u003e Howard and Hampton For many Black boys growing up in poor, urban neighborhoods, their only choice seems to be between various gangs like the Crips and Pirus. Lecrae laments the fact that in a truly better world, he and these other young Black boys would have the opportunity to choose between Howard Unversity and Hampton University, which are two of America’s historically Black colleges and universities (aka HBCUs). I love the people that I ran with but look at the damage Look at the damage “I love the people that I ran with but look at the damage” \u003e Look at the damage In contrast to the dealer who sold his cousin fentanyl and the music labels who exploit rap music addicts, Lecrae shows love and empathy for the peers with whom he grew up, even though many of them eventually chose to gang bang, sell drugs, or profit from some other illegal and destructive activity.\nDespite this love and empathy, Lecrae also seems to be genuinely disturbed as he implores us to “look at the damage” that his peers ccaused throughout their choices to profit from various illegal activity.\nIt’s also notable that the phrase “What’s the damage?” is a way to ask how much someone has to pay for something, particularly for expensive shopping purchases or a restaurant bill. Hence, these peers have been doing physical, emotional, spiritual and financial “damage” to themselves and others so that they can get enough money to pay for the “damage” when they indulge themselves at a store or restaurant. You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin' subsection “You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin’” \u003e subsection Lecrae seems to be having a conversation with one of these former peers where he says, “You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin’”.\nThe phrase “put me on” is a slang way for someone to ask another person to use their position, connections, success or abundance to hook the speaker up, show the speaker undeserved favor, or help the spaker get something that the speaker wants.\nIn this case, the request seems to be from a former peer who is asking Lecrae to use his wealth and status as a successful grammy winning hip hop artist to “put him on” with some kind of economic opportunity.\nLecrae indicates that he is reluctant and will probably refuse to put this former peer on because Lecrae knows that the peer is still involved with illegal activity, particularly scamming people to get money.\nRecall that Kendrick called out rappers and influencers who “glorify scamming” and threats to execute them by saying “you get chipped over this credit card”.\nAs we previously noted, Kendrick’s has mentioned the destructive behavior of scammers on several tracks throughout his career.\nBaby wanna go back to school, but she need some help\nBecause it’s hard trying to pay the bills when you’re by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams, ’til she heard a voice\nThat said, “The Devil is a lie, make a better choice”\n-“Faith”\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt’s not about the right price but more like the right scam\n-“Vanity Slaves”\nCredit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent\n-“LUST.” A crooked doctor took advantage and hooked me on Xanax Xanax “A crooked doctor took advantage and hooked me on Xanax” \u003e Xanax After empathizing with his peers who have profited from illegal activity while also refusing to further enable them, Kendrick calls out the “crooked doctor” who prescribed Xanax to Lecrae, which eventually Lecrae to become addicted.\nXanax is the brand name form of a prescription medication named alprazolam that produces a calming effect on a patient and thus is primarily used to treat anxiety disorders. However, that same calming effect makes it very easy for patients to become addicted.\nWithin the medical system of the United States, there have been numerous examples of corrupt doctors who have overprescribed Xanax to patients when there was little to no medical justification for the patient to be taking Xanax who should not have been using Xanax.\nThese doctors were often incentivized to over prescribe Xanax because of: “Kickback” payments that doctors receive from pharmaceutical companies whenever they prescribe the medication.\nSubmitting to the pressure of patients who demanded Xanax. So called “pill mill” business models where patients can skip insurance coverage and pay cash directly to doctor to obtain Xanax without a justifiable medial reason. In many cases people who were prescribed Xanax without a justification ended up hospitalized or dead.\nA significant amount of the patient demand for Xanax and the subsequent opportunity for “pill mill” business practices for Xanax can be traced to media influencers and stars including hip hop artists who have released a countless number of songs which glorify taking Xanax, or Xans, similar to the trend of making songs about molly.\nThese doctors who over prescribed Xanax along with the pharmaceutical corporations who profited from selling Xanax thus seem to illustrate Kendrick’s point from “Worldwide Steppers” that seemingly everyone is a killer or silent murderer, particularly when those are seeking profit\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology\nSilent murderer, what’s your body count? Who your sponsorship? Since 2017, Lecrae has been vocal about his own personal struggle and journey with anxiety which included a time when he was taking Xanax as prescribed by a doctor.\nOn the 2017 track “Worth It” Lecrae mentioned that stress had led him to be on Xans for a bit before getting off of them.\nI’ve been over-stressin’, I’ve been second guessin’\nI was on them Xan’s for a second, I was feelin’ so defeated On the 2022 track “Deconstruction”, Lecrae went into more details about how his mental, emotional and spiritual struggle led him lose his faith in God and look to Xanax for peace of mind.\n*I ain’t know if God was real no mo’\nEvery day we gettin’ killed and I can’t deal no mo’\nI started slipping in the darkness, I’m feeling heartless\nChristians got me traumatized, I don’t know who God is\nDrinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree\nMaybe I should get divorced, I don’t know why she married me\nWhat’s the purpose? What’s the point?\nNothing matters, I’m just matter, I’m just atoms\nAin’t no Eve and ain’t no Adam\nWhere the Xannies? Let me at ’em\nI was floating in confusion until I dropped\nWoke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped\nSinnin’ like Saul ’til I hit Damascus\nGod knocked me off the mule ‘fore I hit the casket\nHeard a faint voice calling me late, I couldn’t sleep\nIt said, “‘Crae I know you love Me, I need you to feed My sheep”\nTears streaming as I weep, felt I heard the Lord speak\nI’ve been running from You, but You never ran away from me Later in 2024, Lecrae released a podcast episode where he talked at length about his journey with mental health including his diagnosis for ADHD, anxiety and depression along with his positive and negative experiences of take medications.\nIt’s killers sittin’ in they cell for takin’ somebody innocent Killers taking innocent lives “It’s killers sittin’ in they cell for takin’ somebody innocent” \u003e Killers taking innocent lives Having just called out a crooked doctors who have indirectly killed people by overprescribing Xanax, Lecrae shifts his focus to people who have been found guilty and sentenced to time in a prison cell after directly killing an innocent person.\nThis line mirrors the first verse from “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick rapped:\nWe even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives And they don’t even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance No remorse “And they don’t even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance” \u003e No remorse At some level, Lecrae seems to feel genuinely surprised and disappointed to know that some of these killers feel no remorse about taking the life of someone innocent. However, at another level, he is probably not surprised at this lack of remorse based on the earlier lines such as “They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience.”\nLecrae also attributes the killers’ lack of remorse to them displaying the “worst ignorance”.\nAt one level, labeling these killers as “ignorant” in a pejorative sense could be seen as a insult or a justification for them to have an even harsher punishment. However, if you take the word “ignorance” at face value, Lecrae is really just pointing out that these killer are unfortunately lacking in knowledge, education or the ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions.\nIf one recognizes that these killer are really lacking in knowledge, education and the ability to comprehend consequence, it becomes possible to begin empathizing with them, particularly since they may never have been able to choose between Howard and Hampton.\nBut when I take a look in the mirror Mirror “But when I take a look in the mirror” \u003e Mirror After expressing his disdain for crooked doctors and killers who feel no remorse, Lecrae suddenly shifts the focus back to himself as he looks in the mirror.\nThis idea of looking in the mirror to examine oneself—particularly to examine one’s own moral choices virtues and vices—is one of the most common recurring motifs throughout Kendricks albums.\nOn “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city\", Kendrick talked about a girl who was scared of dealing with her emotions and lived behind a mirror.\nYou live in a world, you livin’ behind the mirror\nI know what you’re scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior On “Poetic Justice” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city\", talked to a girl that he was interested in and told here that authentic loved required an individual to look in the mirror.\nLove is not just a verb, it’s you lookin’ in the mirror\nLove is not just a verb, it’s you lookin’ for it, maybe On “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city\", Kendrick began to face his own mistakes that had led to the death of his friend as he rapped.\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself am I really scared of passin’ away?\nIf it’s today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost ’til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin’\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin’ that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I’m doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots On “Real” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city\", after accepting Jesus as his savior Kendrick was finally able to see himself clearly in the mirror.\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I’m there\nWith my hands in the air, I’m proud to say yeah\nI’m real, I’m real, I’m really, really, real On “u” from To Pimp a Butterfly, Kendrick considered committing suicide as he talked to himself in the mirror.\nShould’ve killed yo’ ass long time ago\nYou should’ve felt that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if these mirrors could talk it’d say, “You gotta go”\nAnd if I told your secrets the world’ll know money can’t stop\na suicidal weakness On “i” from To Pimp a Butterfly, Kendrick declared that he loves himself after looking in a mirror.\nAs I look around me\nSo many motherfuckers wanna down me\nBut enemy gon’ never drown me\nIn front of a dirty double-mirror they found me\nAnd I love my, I love myself\nHuh, when you lookin’ at me, ah, tell me what do you see?\nI love myself,\nAhh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli’\nI love myself\nUh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don’t seem shy\nI love myself\nOne day at a time, huh On “XXX.” from DAMN., Kendrick detailed the murderous pattern of thoughts that characterize America before looking in the mirror and seeing that he is an reflection of America.\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\nPass the gin, I mix it with American blood\nThen bash him in, you Crippin’ or you married to Blood?\nI’ll ask again, oops, accident\nIt’s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmerica’s reflections of me, that’s what a mirror does The entire DAMN. also seems to be designed so that first half of the album mirrors the latter half of the album to form a mirrored literary structure known as a “chiasm”.\nOn “Rich Spirit” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick seems to why a particular an keeps looking at the mirror.\nMore power to ya, love ’em from a distance\nWhy you always in the mirror more than the bitches? On “Count Me Out” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick was scared by what he saw in the mirror.\nWipe my ego, dodge my pride\n(And I’m tripping and falling)\nLook myself in the mirror\nAmityville, ain’t seen nothin’ scarier\n…\nWhen you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?\nWhen you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?\n3:30 in the mornin’, scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)\nAin’t nobody but the mirror lookin’ for the fall off (Brrrt) On “Mother I Sober”, Kendrick recalled looking in the mirror as a child recognizing that he was unique and gifted.\nI remember lookin’ in the mirror knowin’ I was gifted\nOnly child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas On “Mirror”, Kedrick personifies “the culture” as a woman as Kendrick tells the personified culture to get a mirror and point it at him to see a reflection of freedom.\n‘Cause all of it’s toxic\nGirl, I’m not relevant to givin’ on profit\nPersonal gain off my pain, it’s nonsense\nDarlin’, my demons is off the leash for a moshpit\nBaby, I just had a baby, you know she need me\nWorkin’ on myself, the counselin’ is not easy\nDon’t you point a finger just to point a finger\n‘Cause critical thinkin’ is a deal-breaker\nFaith in one man is a ship sinking\nDo yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance\nThen point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom\nShe told me that she need me the most, I didn’t believe her\nShe even called me names on the post, the world can see it\nJokes and gaslightin’\nMad at me ‘cause she didn’t get my vote, she say I’m triflin’\nDisregardin’ the way that I cope with my own vices\nMaybe it’s time to break it off\nRun away from the culture to follow my heart Still the most famous reference to someone looking in the mirror in a popular music song can be found in Michael Jackson’s hit single “Man in the Mirror”. On that track, Michael Jackson sang about his recognition that there were so many people in need while the systems of the world were not making the changes needed to address their needs. Michael Jackson came to the conclusion that any change would need to start with Michael looking in the mirror to see his own selfishness and start to make change in himself and in the world.\nI’m gonna make a change for once in my life\nIt’s gonna feel real good\nGonna make a difference, gonna make it right\nAs I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat\nThis wind is blowin’ my mind\nI see the kids in the street with not enough to eat\nWho am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?\nA summer’s disregard, a broken bottle top\nAnd a one man’s soul\nThey follow each other on the wind, ya know\n‘Cause they got nowhere to go\nThat’s why I want you to know\nI’m starting with the man in the mirror\nI’m asking him to change his ways\nAnd no message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make a change The blood of Uriah's on my hands 'cause I'm that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters Killer “The blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer” \u003e Killer As Lecrae looks in the mirror as he confesses himself to be a killer.\nBy expressing anger, sadness and criticism of those who unjustly kill others and the suddenly turning to acknowledge that he himself is a killer, Lecrae depicts himself as a hypocrite similar to Kendrick at the end of the track “Blacker the Berry” from *To Pimp a Butterfly\"\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite! In contrast to the “ignorant” “killers sittin’ in they cell” who “don’t feel no remorse”, Lecrae clearly feels a great amount of remorse for being a killer. This remorse is emphasized by the phrase “blood on my hands” which is usually used to emphasize that a person is responsible for another person’s death even if the responsible person did not directly kill them.\nDavid, Bathsheba and Uriah “The blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer who had Bathsheba” \u003e David, Bathsheba and Uriah In particular, by saying he is “that killer” with “the blood of Uriah” on his hand after having “Bathsheba in his quarters”, Lecrae is clearly depicting himself as someone who has perpetrated the same evil actions as King David.\nIn the Bible, David is an iconic King of Israel who committed adultery with a woman named Bathsheba and then ordered Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah to be killed in order to cover up his adultery.\nAs a young boy David was anointed with oil to mark him as the future of Israel. David subsequently displayed a remarkable amount of trust in God, which allowed him to rise up from a small shepherd boy to a boy who defeated a giant soldier named Goliath, and eventually was crowned King over all Israel.\nGod blessed King David with tremendous military success due to many loyal soldiers including a man named Uriah who served David even though the man was not an Isralite. Also,because polygamy was allowed at the time, David was able to marry seven wives who had already given birth to six sons.\nHowever, even after all of this success and all these women, King David was overcome with sexual desire when one night David went up to his roof and saw a woman naked while she was bathing in a house next to David’s palace. David used his servants to find out that this woman’s name was Bathsheba. They also found that she was the wife of Uriah, one of King David’s most loyal soldiers, who at the time was away from home for months as he was on the battlefield fighting for David’s army.\nDespite knowing that Bathseba was married to his neighbor and loyal soldier and despite already having seven wives with whom he could have sex as he pleased and the ability to marry additional women who were not yet married, David was overcome by lust and sexual desire. He then used his royal power to order servants to bring Bathsheba to his royal quarters where David then forced her to have sex with him.\nAfter some weeks went by, Bathsheba sent a message to King David telling him that she was pregnant. Moreover, since her husband Uriah, her husband was away at war for months, whenever Bathsheba began to be visibly pregnant, everyone would know that she had committed adultery even if they didn’t initially know with whom she had sex. She would thus face punishment, potentially even the death penalty, for adultery even though King David was the one who had forced her to have sex with him and under a strict observance of the laws of Moses should be punished by death.\nWanting to continue his sexual relationship with Bathsheba, father an additional child, and avoid the shame and punishment of exposing his own adultery, King David concocted a scheme in which he sent a messenger to bring Uriah back from the battlefield to the palace. Once Uriah got to the palace, David told Uriah to go sleep at his house down the street, thinking that if Uriah went to his house he would have sex with his wife, Bathsheba. Then whenever Uriah and everyone else found out that Bathsheba was pregnant, they would assume Uriah had fathered the child from the night that he came home from the battlefield.\nHowever, David’s scheme did not work. Uriah was so loyal to King David and his fellow soldiers that he refused to sleep in his own bed or have sex with his wife while the rest of David’s soldiers were in rough conditions on the battle front. David even tried to get Uriah drunk thinking that this would cause Uriah to have self control over his sexual desire so that he would go home and have sex with Bathsheba. However, Uriah just ended up sleeping at the door of the palace.\nAfter David realized that Uriah was too loyal to go home and have sex with his wife, David decided that he had to kill Uriah immediately so that he could marry Bathsheba and make it look as if the baby was conceived after his marriage to Bathsheba.\nDavid then concocted a new scheme in which he wrote a letter to his army general which instructed the general to position Uriah at the most fierce part of the battle front. Then as the enemy attacked the general was to tell all the Israelite soldiers around Uriah to withdraw, leaving Uriah undefended so that he could be killed by enemy soldiers. To make his plan even more diabolical, David gave this letter to take to the general on his way back to the battlefield. Uriah again proved to be so loyal that he did not read the letter, though he was carrying his own execution order back to the general.\nAfter King David’s murderous scheme worked, David married Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba, who soon gave birth to David’s son without any human knowing that David had committed adultery and murder.\nHowever, God knew. God sent a prophet to confront and expose King David for his adultery and murder. King David knew that he was in the wrong, immediately confessed, and repented. Due to this repentance the prophet said that God had forgiven David and would not give David the death penalty.\nDesipte God forgiving David, the prophet said that the “Uriah’s blood was his hands” and as a natural consequence of David’s adultery and murder, death, bloodshed, and sexual abuse would haunt David’s family, begining with the death of the son that King David had fathered through the act of adultery. Kendrick, Sherane and Dave “The blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer who had Bathsheba” \u003e Kendrick, Sherane and Dave Kendrick has clearly reflected on the story of King David and how the lessons from King David’s story might apply to Kendrick’s own life. Most notably, just a few days before the release of Kendrick’s major label debut album “good kid, m.A.A.d city”, Kendrick released the track “The Heart Pt. 3” where Kendrick expressed how the pressure he faced as a rising hip hop star made him want pray and read “the Book of David”.\n‘Cause when the whole world see you as ‘Pac reincarnated\nEnough pressure to make you just open the Book of David\nAnd pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix\n‘Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it’s quite contagious On “The Heart Pt. 3”, Kendrick also mentioned the girl named Sherane who would go on to be a pivotal figure in the storyline of good kid, m.A.A.d city\nThinking ‘bout when Sherane tried to set me up\nCold game, full circle—they set up her. On “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter”, the first track on good kid, m.A.A.d city, tells the story of how a 17 year old Kendrick met a girl named Sherane at a house party. Kendrick was immediately overwhelmed by sexual desire for Sherane which caused him to ignore the potential danger that he could get into with Sherane’s male family members who had a history of gang banging. Kendrick thus proceeded to get Sherane’s number, start a texting relationships and eventually drive to Sherane’s house in hopes of having sex with her.\nI met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central\nShe had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta\nAss came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel\nI want to ride like Arabians, push an ‘04 Mercedes-Benz\n“Hello, my name is Kendrick,” she said, “No, you’re handsome”\nWhispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin’\nCiara had played in the background\nThe parade music we made had us all wearin’ shades now, cool\n“Where you stay?” She said, “Down the street from Dominguez High”\nOkay, I know that’s borderline Compton or Paramount\n“Well, is it Compton?” “No,” she replied\nThen quickly start battin’ her eyes\nI strictly had wanted her thighs around me\nSeventeen with nothin’ but pussy stuck on my mental\nMy motive was rather sinful, “What you tryna get into?”\nShe didn’t tell, just gave me her Nextel\nDropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well\nThe summer had passed, and now I’m likin’ her\nConversation we havin’ probably enticin’ her\nWho can imagine? Maybe my actions’ll end up wifin’ her\nLove or lust, regardless, we’ll fuck ‘cause the trife in us\nIt’s deep-rooted, the music of bein’ young and dumb\nIs never muted, in fact, it’s much louder where I’m from\nWe know a lot ‘bout each other, her mother was a crack addict\nShe live with her granny and her younger two brothers\nHer favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible\nFamily history of gangbangin’ did make me skeptical\nBut not enough to stop me from gettin’ a nut\n“I wanna come over, what’s up?”\nThat’s what I told her soon as this episode\nOf Martin go off, I’m tryna get off\nI was in heat like a cactus\nMy tactics of bein’ thirsty probably could hurt me\nBut fuck it, I got some heart\nGrabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy\nSo now I’m down Rosecrans in a Caravan\nPassin’ Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump\nI got enough to get me through the traffic jam\nAt least I hope, ‘cause my pockets broke as a promise, man\nI’m thinkin’ ‘bout that sex\nThinkin’ ‘bout her thighs or maybe kissin’ on her neck\nor maybe what position’s next\nSent a picture of her titties, blowin’ up my texts\nI looked at ’em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette\nEnthused by the touch of a woman, she’s a masseuse\nAnd I’m a professional pornstar when off the Goose\nI had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom\nI’m hopin’ to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem However, when Kedrick pulled up to Sherane’s house he was questioned and then beaten up by two young Black men in black hoodies.\nI’m two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet\nAnd six steps from where she stay, she wavin’ me ‘cross the street\nI pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see\nTwo niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang\n-“Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter”\n“I’m gon’ ask you one more time, homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem.”\n“Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ask him if he over here for Sherane. Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?”\n“I don’t care who this nigga over here for, if he don’t tell me where he from, it’s a wrap, I’m sorry”\n“Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, we gon’ do it like this, okay? I’ma tell you where I’m from, okay? You gon’ tell me where you from, okay? Or, or, or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?”\n“Fuck all this talkin’. As a matter fact, get out the van, homie. Get out the car ‘fore I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie\n-“Poetic Justice” After getting beaten up Kendrick made it back to his homies. The homies then found out about Sherane had set Kendrick up to get stomped on, just like Kendrick mentioned on “The Heart Pt. 3”.\nThinking ‘bout when Sherane tried to set me up\nCold game, full circle—they set up her. The homies drove back to Sherane’s neighborhood looking to fire gunshots at the two guys in hoodies who beat Kendrick up. However, this plan for revenge went horribly wrong when the guys in hoodies shot back and killed Kendrick’s friend, Dave as heard during a skit at the end of “Swimming Pools (Drank) - Extended Version”.\n”They stomped the homie out over a bitch? K-Dot, you good, blood? Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off\" “That nigga’s straight, man, that nigga ain’t trippin’” “We gon’ do the same ol’ shit. I’ma pop a few shots, they gon’ ru—they run opposite way, fall right in [BLEEP]’s lap and he gon’ tear they ass up, simple as that”\n“And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there. We gon’ pop that bitch too” “Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody”\n[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]\n“Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?”\n“L[BLEEP], you good?”\n“Yeah, blood, I’m good – Dave, you good? Dave? Dave, say somethin’ – Dave? These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!” Right after that scene from the end of “Swimming Pools (Drank) - Extended Version”, the album transitions into the pivotal track, “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”. In the first verse of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”, Kendrick raps from the perspective of Dave’s brother as Kendrick describes himself literally and metaphorically having “blood on his hands”.\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, as blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan’s rather vindictive\nEverybody’s a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it’s a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering “Get ’em!”\nI got ’em and I ain’t give a fuck\nThat same mentality that told my brother not to duck good kid, m.A.A.d. city thus tells the story of how Kendrick’s uncontrolled sexual desire led to the death of his loyal friend, Dave, which mirrors how King David’s uncontrolled sexual desire led to the death of his loyal soldier, Uriah.\nLecrae, a girlfriend and an unborn child “The blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer who had Bathsheba” \u003e Lecrae, a girlfriend and an unborn child In contrast to Kendrick, Lecrae has never given any indication that he was significantly involved with any shooting or gang activity that could have led to someone’s death. We may then wonder, why Lecrae claims that he has “blood on his hands”.\nGiven that Lecrae’s confession about being a killer is tied to a confession about having sex with someone who he shouldn’t have been having sex with, it is likely that Lecrae is alluding to an earlier period of his life when he impregnated a woman who later had an abortion.\nThe choices that led to the abortion happened after Lecrae had already become a Christian and in theory accepted the idea that he shouldn’t have sex outside of marriage. However, like King David, Lecrae’s old habits and desires drove him to remain sexually active with a girlfriend. Like Bathsheba, the girlfriend at some point told Lecrae that she was pregnant.\nDue to the influence of the Christian community that he was part of, Lecrae had theoretically accepted the idea that he should not advocate for an abortion in this particular situation. The girlfriend was also apparently open to the idea of keeping the pregnancy. However, Lecrae was unwilling to take on the responsibility of becoming a father while risking his opportunities and image, so he helped sway the girl towards the decision of having an abortion.\nLecrae recounts the true story of this abortion on the first verse of “Good, Bad, Ugly”.\nRemember back in ‘02\nWhen I was in school and actin’ a fool\nMy soul got saved\nMy debt had been paid\nBut still I kept running off with my crew\nSex on my brain and death in my veins\nHad a main thang we stayed up til 2\nSmokin’\nWaking and bakin’ we naked\nMy body was lovin’ it\nSoul was hatin’ it\nTime and time after time\nOur bodies grew close the girl was so fine\nHeard a heart beat that wasn’t hers or mine\nThe miracle of life had started inside\nMy God\nIgnored the warning signs\nSupressed that truth I felt inside\nI was just havin’ fun with this\nI’m too young for this\nI’m thinkin’ me myself and I\nShould I sacrifice this life\nTo keep my vanity and live nice\nAnd she love and trust me so much\nThat whatever I say she’ll probably oblige\nBut I was too selfish with my time\nScared my dreams were not gone survive\nSo I dropped her off at that clinic\nThat day a part of us died Since Lecrae has held to the conviction that an unborn child with a heartbeat is a life, when Lecrae looks in the mirror, he sees himself as a killer who took the life of somebody innocent. Rather than taking the life of a loyal neighbor like Uriah, Lecrae likely feels even more guilty about taking the life of what would have been his first born child.\nI’m that— Censored “I’m that—” \u003e Censored We never actually hear what Lecrae intended to say after “I’m that—”. It seems like Lecrae is censoring his own lyrics similar to how Kendrick censored his own lyrics on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick menitoned Lecrae by name as he rapped:\nSometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1\nBut I will— With Kendrick lines from “Watch the Party Die” we didn’t arrive at much certainty about what exactly the uncensored line would have been. However, in the case of Lecrae’s censored line we do have some more potential clues. In particular, we can note that the bar before the censored line ends with Lecrae saying “I’m that killer” and the bar after the censored line ends with Lecrae saying “I’m that sinner”. If the censored line is following the pattern of those other two lines, we could expect that the censored part of the line should be a single two-syllable word which has a short “i” in the first syllable and an “er” sound ending the second consonant. Of all words that would fit these requirements the most likely choice would be the word “nigger”, which would mean that the uncensored line is “I’m that nigger”.\nCensoring the word “nigger” would make a lot of sense for Lecrae since Lecrae releases music in the Christian hip hop sub-genre where explicit songs with profanity or racial epithets are not socially acceptable to most of the core audience.\nI’m that nigga “I’m that—” \u003e I’m that nigga The phrase “I’m that nigga” is a very popular catchphrase within mainstream hip hop culture and has been used in the lyrics of a countless rappers to depict themselves as strong, proud, hyper-masculine individuals who can get money by any means necessary, intimidate their enemies and have sex with the most attactive women wherever they go.\nThe popularity of the phrase “I’m that nigga” can likely be tracked back to the Soul singer Curtis Mayfield’s 1972 song “Pusherman” which plays during the opening scene of the 1972 black exploitation (aka blaxploitation) film Super Fly. Super Fly glorifies the life of a successful drug dealer who boasts of having lots of money and having sex with lots of women.

God provides humanity with an abundance of delicious fruit trees to eat.\nGod splits humanity into a male and a female. The male was later referred to as “Adam” which means “human” while the female was referred to as “Eve” which means “life”.\nGod tells Adam and Eve that they can live forever in the delightful garden if they follow God’s one commandment to not eat the fruit from one particular tree. However, if anyone eats the fruit from this particular tree that person will die. This “forbidden” tree was is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and represented the choice to redefine what actions should be considered good and bad without having to listen to God’s instructions.\nHowever, one day a spiritual figure speaks to Eve in the form of a snake and suggests that she should eat the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Initially, Eve restrains herself by recounting God’s instruction that she will die if she eats the fruit. However, the snake convinces Eve that God had not told her the truth and is holding her back from gaining great wisdom and becoming like God.\nEve then eats the forbidden fruit and also gives some of the fruit to Adam who also eats the fruit despite knowing God’s instructions. Immediately, the two of them realize that they are naked and vulnerable to be taken advantage of by the other. Adam and Eve then make clothes to cover their vulnerability and shame.\nWhen God comes to confront Adam and Eve about the decision to eat the forbidden fruit, both of them try to shift blame to the other or to the snake or to God rather than taking responsibility for their own actions.\nGod then forces Adam and Eve into exile outside the delightful paradise garden where they will eventually die without access to the life-giving fruit that God had actually permitted them to eat in the garden. Similar to Adam, Lecrae knew God’s instructions which had forbidden him from having sex outside of lifelong commitment to his partner but due to his own desires and the snake-like influence of peers, music, movies, tv shows, and drugs Lecrae had disregarded God’s instructions thinking that he could decide for himself what sexual behavior should be considered good and bad. Lecrae’s decision to disregard God’s instruction ultimately led to the death of his relationship with his girlfriend and the end of what would have been Lecrae’s first born child.\nHowever, now as Lecrae examines himself in the mirror, he takes responsibility for his own actions including his actions that led to the abortion. Lecrae even takes responsibility for some of they choices that his girlfriend might now regret as Lecrae says that he was the one who “let Eve taste the fruit of death.” When applied to Lecrae’s own situation with the abortion, Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that he failed in his responsibility of preventing his girlfriend from facing the tough decision to get an abortion.\nFirst and foremost, Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that played a significant role in getting his girlfriend to have sex with him. Moreover, as Lecrae mentioned in “Good, Bad, Ugly”, his girlfriend had such strong feelings for him that she probably would have kept the baby if Lecrae had been willing and supportive. However, from Lecrae’s perspective, his selfish focus on his own pleasure and success placed his girlfriend in a position where having an abortion seemed to be the wisest choice.\nAnd she love and trust me so much\nThat whatever I say she’ll probably oblige\nBut I was too selfish with my time\nScared my dreams were not gone survive\nSo I dropped her off at that clinic\nThat day a part of us died I’m that sinner Sinner “I’m that sinner” \u003e Sinner By depicting himself as Adam, Lecrae is also depicting himself as the prototypical sinner.\nIn biblical terminology, the word “sin” is used to refer to a failure to achieve a goal or reach a destination or follow directions.\nIn the Bible, Adam and Eve are presented as the first sinners because they failed to follow the direction that God had given them and thus failed to achieve their goal of continuing to live in the delightful garden.\nWhile later biblical characters do not receive the same directions that God gave to Adam and Eve, the authors of the Bible conveyed the idea that God does provide directions that are meant to be followed by all humans. Most notably, the prophet Micah addresses a prototypical human using the Hebrew word “adam” and says that God requires humans to “act with justice, show mercy to others, and be humble.”\nThe LORD has shown you, O human (Hebrew: adam), what is good.\nWhat does the LORD require of you, but to act with justice,\nto love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?\n-Micah 6:8 Based on the prophet Micah’s summary of God’s directions, humans sin when they act in a way that is unjust, unmerciful or pridefully unconcerned with others. Based on this criteria, Lecrae would likely see his past actions as truly sinful not necessarily because it broke some clearly stated rule about sex or abortions, but because he clearly acted in a way that focused on exalting his own pleasure and pride regardless of whether such actions led to outcomes that were unjust or unmerciful for his girlfriend or for his potential first born child.\nI deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites Deserve death “I deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites” \u003e Deserve death From a modern perspective, it sounds extreme and unreasonable for Lecrae to say that he deserves death for having sex outside of a committed relationship whether or not this led to an abortion. However, within the context of this verse these lines should be understood as part of Lecrae comparing himself to King David and Adam.\nRecall that when God sent the prophet Nathan to confront King David for murdering his neighbor after committing adultery with his neighbor’s wife, God acknowledged that David deserved to die for his unjust actions. However, because David repented, God forgave David and did not condemn David to death.\nMoreover, going back to the beginning of the Bible, God told Adam that if he ate the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, he would die which is what eventually happened after Adam sinned by disobeying God’s commandment.\nLater in the New Testament section of the Bible, in his letter to the Church in Rome, St. Paul reflects on how the sin of breaking God’s law leads to death for Adam who represents all of humanity.\nTherefore as sin entered into the world through one human, and death through sin; so death passed to all humans, because all sinned…death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the violation of trust from Adam, who is a prototype of him who was to come\n-Romans 5:12-14 This idea of sin as a failure to act with justice, love mercy and be humble which ultimately leads to the spread of death to all humans is an idea that Kendrick has explored, most notably in the intro to the track “PRIDE.”.\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me and— If Lecrae’s past action are part of the problem that leads to the cycle of sin and death, it follows that Lecrae is thus deserving of death.\nLiars and hypocrites “I deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites” \u003e Liars and hypocrites Lecrae acknowledge that his past actions have shown him to be a liar and a hypocrite.\nIf Lecrae is a liar, the natural conclusion is that he deserves to die along with the other targets of Kendrick’s execution orders on “Watch the Party Die”.\nI think it’s time to watch the party die\nStreet niggas and the corporate guys,\nthe rappers that report the lies\nI need they families mortified\nWe can do life without ’em. Get they bodies organized. It is also notable that throughout the battle with Drake, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being a liar, as we discussed in the analysis of the line “the rappers that report the lies”.\nBy acknowleding himself as a “liar and hypocrite”, Lecrae seems to be saying that he is no better than those who have “burned their own conscience” and negatively influence others as St. Paul discussed in his first letter to Timothy and Lecrae alluded to earlier when he said “They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience.”\nThe Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, under the influence of liars and hypocrites who have burned their own conscience as with a branding iron.\n-1 Timothy 4:1-2 The word “hypocrite” entered into the English language through its use in translations of the original Greek New Testament Gospel accounts. In Greek, the word “hypokritēs” originally referred to a stage actor who wears a mask and assumes a role in a play.\nIn the Gospel accounts, Jesus uses the word “hypocrite” as a pejorative criticism of his people’s religious leaders who peformed religious practices such as prayer, fasting and charity primiarly so that they could be seen and honored by other people like an actor looking for applause from an audience. Hence, their religious practices was not rooted in actual love for God or love for other people. Instead, their religious practices were rooted in self-centered focus on their own status, power and fame.\nLecrae seems to recognize that he was clearly being a “hypocrite” or “stage actor” when he publicly claimed to be a Christian who follows God’s instructions while privately disobeying God’s instructions and leading his girlfriend to have an abortion to selfishly preserve his own dreams of becoming a famous rapper.\nIt is notable that in the first few lines of “euphoria”, Kendrick’s first battle track that directly aimed at Drake, Kendrick referred to Drake as an “actor”\nThem super powers gettin’ neutralized, I can only watch in silence\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now is spiralin' Also, on the battle track “meet the grahams”, Kendrick implores Drake to take off the mask that he has been using to play his staged role as he repeated lied everything that was important.\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help However, back in 2015 when Drake and rapper Meek Mill released diss tracks that began over allegations that Drake had used ghostwriters, Kendrick also released the To Pimp a Butterfly track “Black the Berry”, where Kendrick acknowledge that he was actually the biggest hypocrite of the year when he spoke about bringing peace and unity within the Black community even though he was responsible for killing another young Black man.\nI’m the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\n…\nI’m the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nWhen I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree\n…\nIt’s funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin’ with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don’t matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State “Marcus Garvey got all the answers”\nOr try to celebrate February like it’s my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET ‘cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite! Now with Kendrick’s own battle against Drake in 2024, Kendrick seems to have lost the spiritual clarity that he had back in 2015 when he recognized that he might be the biggest hypocrite.\nFake tough rappers who fabricate they predicaments Fake fabricating rappers “Fake tough rappers who fabricate they predicaments” \u003e Fake fabricating rappers Lecrae calls out “fake tough rappers” who make up or “fabricate” the challenging situations or predicaments that they have gone through, likely in order to objain credibility from “street niggas”. Lecrae seems to point to such rappers as an example of the “liars and hypocrites” whom he is no better than.\nThese “fake tough rappers” who “fabricate” their “predicaments” seems be included among the “steet niggas” and “rappers that report the lies” who Kendrick ordered to be executed in the first few lines of the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”.\nI think it’s time to watch the party die\nStreet niggas and the corporate guys\nthe rappers that report the lies\nI need they families mortified\nWe can do life without ’em. Get they bodies organized. Fake deep gurus pushin’ voodoo on the people Fake deep gurus “Fake deep gurus pushin’ voodoo on the people” \u003e Fake deep gurus In addition to the “fake tough rappers”, Lecrae also calls out “fake deep gurus”.\nIn contemporary English, the word “guru” is often used to refer to an insightful and influential teacher who has made a career or commercial enterprise out of giving practical advice about how people should think and act in particular environments or roles. These include management gurus, marketing gurus, tech guru, entrepreneurship guru, health gurus, parenting gurus, lifestyle gurus or self-help gurus.\nAt the same time, it’s important to note that the word guru comes from Hinduism in India where it was originally used to refer to a respected spiritual teacher.\nWhile it is possible that Lecrae is criticizing a wide variety of commercialized gurus, the description of gurus who are “pushin’ voodoo” and “Tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real” suggests that Lecrae is very specifically talking about “fake deep” spiritual gurus. Pushin’ voodoo on the people “Fake deep gurus pushin’ voodoo on the people” \u003e Pushin’ voodoo on the people The term “voodoo” refers to a set spiritual beliefs and practices that mix indigenous forms of West African spirituality with certain aspects of Roman Catholic Christianity. Voodoo develop after enslaved Africans were brought to the Haiti, Louisiana and other French-speaking areas of the Western Hemisphere.\nWhile voodoo encorporates aspects of Roman Catholic Christianity, most traditional branches of Christianity have consistently rejected voodoo as satanic or at the very least incompatible with a traditional understanding of Christian belief and practice.\nAs a Christian rapper and one of the most influential Black voices among Millennial and Gen Z Chrisitans, Lecrae’s antagonism towards fake deep spiritual gurus is likely due to the fact that an increasing number of Millenials and Gen Z Americans are drifting far away from churches, Christianity, and “organized religion” while still retain a strong sense of personal spirituality.\nThis outlook is often referred to as being “spiritual but not religious” and is seen as a way to pick and choose the spiritual practices that a person sees as most appealing or beneficial while being free to reject rules, structure, authority, or beliefs that do not align with a modern, liberal, secular perspective.\nIndividuals who align themselves with the “spiritual but not religious” perspective often are attracted by various Eastern spiritual practices from Hinduism and Buddhism such as meditation, chanting, astrology, burning incense, crystal healing, herbal medicine and certain forms of yoga.\nThese practices were popularized in America after the Counterculture movements of the 1960s which largely rejected existing Western values and beliefs associated with Christianity and paved the way for “New Age” spirituality which adopted the aforementioned Eastern spiritual practices from Hinduism and Buddhism and combined them with some reinterpretations of Christianity and a modern, liberal, secular perspective.\nThe growth of the New Age movement in 1960s and 1970s America was aided by several spiritual gurus who came from India or other places in Asia and taught various practices and ways of thought to those who were interested in what would come to be known as New Age spirituality.\nIn order to authenticity transmit ideas and perspectives from Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern spiritual tradition to people who are raised in a Western culture that was deeply influenced by Christianity, gurus often would often challenge or de-emphasize certain traditional Christian beliefs such as the idea that there is a single God who was should be worshiped.\nIt is notable that those who adopted New Age spirituality in the 1960s and 1970s were primarily White Americans. At that time, the vast majority of Black Americans identified as Christian with less than ten percent of Black Americans identifying as not religious, Muslim or some other non-Christian religion.\nHowever, as Millennial and Gen Z individuals became teenagers and adults in the beginning in 2000s a significant number of young Black Americans began to identify themselves as spiritual but not religious including many who were raised by parents who identified as Christian.\nAlong with this increase in individuals who identified as spiritual but not religious, an increasing number of Black Americans began to adopt various Eastern spiritual practices and beliefs that had been popularized by the New Age movement and spiritual gurus in the 1960s and 1970s.\nAdditionally, by the 2010s a growing number of African Americans began to incorporate various practices from indigenous African spiritual traditions, most notably practices from Ifa, a spiritual tradition from the Yoruba region in Nigeria, Benin and Togo.\nDue to the displacement of the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved Africans brought Ifa and other indigenous spiritual traditions to the Western Hemisphere where they were often mixed with certain aspects of Christianity to form new spiritual traditions such as Santeria in Cuba, Candomle in Brazil, Vodou in Haiti and Voodoo in Louisiana.\nAll of these traditions include many core practices from Ifa and other indigenous spiritual traditions such as the worship of numerous deities (originally known as Orisha), sacrificial offerings, divination to communicate with deities or predict the future, ancestor veneration, and rituals to induce a worshiper to be possessed by spirits.\nThe increased interest and adoption of Ifa inspired practices can be seen in many hip hop and R\u0026B projects released in the decade prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die” and “Die for the Party”.\n“High \u0026 Holy” the final track on Killer Mike’s Grammy-winning 2023 album, MICHAEL, opens with Yoruba speaker praying to Ifa’s Orisha deities and the bones of ancestors.\nJe ki owo…wa…\nJe ki alafia fun wa\nJe ki ere … fun wa\nJe ki Olodumare ati orisha ati gbobo egun\nAribo Baba wa, Olodumare bless the west\nJay-Z has made numerous references to spiritual connections with ancestors and Orisha deities from Ifa, Santeria and Voodoo.\n*My saint’s Changó, light a candle\nEl Gran Santo on the mantle\n-“Pound Cake”\nWhat ancestors did you summon to the summit\nTo give me what I needed, what you need to take from ’em\n-“Adnis”\nI got bloodlines in Benin, that explains the voodoo\n-“We Family”\nI’m a miracle born with imperial features\nI’m a page turner, sage burner, Santeria\nChongón, December baby, my Orishas\nSaint Hov, story takes place in ancient Egypt\nThey’ll cut off the nose to spite their face, they’ll steal ya Jesus\nI can’t tell Hattie White that blue-eyed version is make believe stuff\n-“The Neverending Story” Still the most visible examples of Ifa’s influence on African American popular culture can be seen in Beyoncé’s films for Lemonade and Black Is King.\nOn both Lemonade and Black Is King Beyoncé surrounds herself with water and wears a flowing yellow dress that seems to be a nod to traditional depictions of the Ifa sex, fertility and river deity, Oshun.\nOn Black is King Beyoncé also wears outfits that seem to be inspired by other Ifa deities including, Obatala, Yemoja Oba and Oshumare.\nOne scene in Black Is King also shows Beyoncé looking through Robert Farris Thompson’s illustrated book Black Gods and King, which contains numerous pictures and descriptions of Yoruba artwork that often depicts Ifa deities,\nThe most direct acknowledgments of Ifa are found on “Black Parade” the song that plays during the film credits and at the end of the album. On “Black Parade”, Beyoncé makes numerous references to Ifa deities, attending Ifa ceremonies, praying to ancestors and adopting New Age practices.\nGrowin’, growin’ like a Baobab tree\nOf life on fertile ground, my ancestors put me on game\nAnkh charm on gold chains, with my Oshun energy, oh\nDrip all on me, woo, Ankara Dashiki print\nHol’ up, don’t I smell like such a nag champa incense?\n…\nI charge my crystals in a full moon\nYou could send them missiles, I’ma send my goons\nBaby sister reppin’ Yemaya (Yemaya)\n…\nWaist beads from Yoruba (Woo)\n…\nChildren’ runnin’ through the house to my art, all black\nAncestors on the wall, let the ghosts chit-chat\nHold my hands, we gon’ pray together\nLay down, face down in the gravel\nWoo, wearin’ all attire white to the funeral\nBlack love, we gon’ stay together Tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real, that’s real evil My God “Tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real, that’s real evil” \u003e My God In many cases, African Americans have distanced themselves from Christianity, embraced New Age or Voodoo spiritual practices, and in some cases tried to convince others that the God Christianity is not real because they see Christianity as a “White man’s religion” that is primarily associated with Western Europe, colonialism, slavery, segregation, and racism.\nThe fact that Western cultures tend to depict Jesus as a White European further emphasizes the perception that Christians worship “the White man’s god”.\nWith the line “tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real” Lecrae pushes back against these seemingly racially charged accusations against Chrisitanity by saying “my God” which emphasizes his deeply personal connection to God that is not based on White people, American identity or Western culture.\nIt is notable that over the course of the previous seven years, Lecrae had rapped about his journey and struggles with reconciling his Black identity with negative racial experiences among Christians that caused Lecrae to doubt whether God is real.\nOn “Come and Get Me”, Lecrae rapped about how prior to his rap career, his mother taught him not let the American education system fool him into thinking that God is a White man.\nTwenty-four years old, my momma brought me to the globe\nTried to tell me it was cold and taught me how to keep the coat\nNow, now, now she told me to go to school and get my education\nBut remember there’s a bias to them books that they be makin’\nGave me, Soul on Ice and taught me\n‘Bout the Middle Passage, told me\nGod ain’t white and that there’s\nMore to life than rap Meanwhile, on the song “Deconstruction”, Lecrae raps about a period of his career in the 2010s when White Christians criticized and rejected him for speaking out about racial injustice and the killings of unarmed Black men. This criticism from White Christians pushed Lecrae towards the influence of several non-Christian Black thinkers who led him to doubt whether God was real.\nI would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such\nYou know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch\nI was so involved, never thought that I could fall, y’all\nRight before the fall of 2015, I was all off\nIt involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down\nTweeted ‘bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground\nAnd Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times\nThis time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized\nDoubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame\n“Shame on you, ‘Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus’ name”\nCut me deep, I was losing sleep, “God, ain’t these Your sheep?”\nWhy they hate me like they do?

Lecreae discussed this breakthrough on “Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)” and “Deconstruction”.\nAnd recently I found a peace to be\nEverything that I was meant to be\nThis my identity, this what He give to me\nThis what I’m made to be\nMy daddy still on that crack\nAnd he might never come back\nBut I still love the man, I don’t judge the man\nI could be on that track\nI’m glad that Jesus ain’t American\nAnd that’s the reason why I care again\nPeople started praying for me\nAnd homies tellin’ me I was being arrogant\nI quit poppin’ them pills\nAnd even though we get killed\nI know that God got a greater plan\nFor the death and blood that we spill\nSo tell depression it can fly away\nTell my doubts that they can die today\nI’ma catch me a wave, sail away\nCan’t stop me now\n-“Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)”\nHeard a faint voice calling me late, I couldn’t sleep\nIt said, “‘Crae I know you love Me, I need you to feed My sheep”\nTears streaming as I weep, felt I heard the Lord speak\nI’ve been running from You, but You never ran away from me\nIt was people that hurt me, it wasn’t God, though\nI let the church trauma turn into a God wound\nI learned the western world has twisted up the Scriptures, so when I re-enlisted\nI learned the eastern context the way that Jesus meant it\nMy peace has been cemented, my soul has been re-lifted\nMy deconstruction ended, reconstruction is beginning\n-“Deconstruction” Having personal gone through his own mental and spiritual crisis of faith, Lecrae now seems to now have a deeper, more personal connection with his God.\nLecrae is also particularly critical of “fake deep gurus” whose shallow teachings could lead other Black Christians to unnecessarily through the kind of mental and spiritual crisis that Lecrae went through.\nReal evil “Tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real, that’s real evil” \u003e Real evil Lecrae goes so far as to say that the fake deep gurus who lead Black people away from God are participating in “real evil”.\nFrom Lecrae’s perspective, if his God is the source of all that is good, it naturally follows that pushing people away from God is pushing them away from experiencing good and towards experiencing evil.\nThis pattern of leading God’s people to doubt God’s goodness and seek wisdom outside the bounds of a relationship with God is the same pattern that is depicted in the biblical Garden of Eden narrative where the snake convinces Adam and Eve to distrust God and acquire wisdom by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.\nNow the snake was more shrewd than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”.\nThe woman said to the snake, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”\nThe snake said to the woman, “You won’t really die, for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.\n-Genesis 3:1-6 Throughout the New Testament, the snake is connected to the figure that is the primary source of evil who is known as the devil meaning “false accuser”, the satan meaning “adversary” or the “evil one”. This figure is described as someone who snatches away Jesus’s words about God’s rulership over humans and fights against the spiritual forces of good.\nWhen anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.\n-Matthew 13:19\nFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the elemental forces, against the powers, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace, above all, take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n-Ephesians 6:12-17\nThere was war in the heavens. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war. They didn’t prevail. No place was found for them any more in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\n-Revelation 12:7-9 Hence, by saying “that’s real evil” Lecrae seems to be asserting that the “fake deep gurus” are doing the work of the evil one by trying to snatch away people’s belief in God’s word and using shrewd but deceptive argument to deconstruct Christian faith.\nHuh, I wonder what Lecrae would do What would I do? “Huh, I wonder what Lecrae would do” \u003e What would I do? Lecrae refers to himself in the third person as he quotes from Kendrick’s line from “Watch the Party Die”.\nSometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?\n…\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do Lecrae now seems to be posing the question to himself. Lecrae thus shows a notable amount of self awareness and humility by recognizing that none of us really know what we would do if we were placed in the exact same situation as another person. This is essentially the same point Lecrae made early when he reflected on Kendrick and said “I can’t imagine his position”.\nAfter looking in the mirror and confessing his own hypocrisy and injustice against the innocent, Lecrae seems keenly aware of the fact that he does not always act in a way that is consistent with his words, his beliefs or with Jesus’s teaching.\nLecrae’s humility and awareness of his human limitations leads him to simply hope that he would do what he thinks would the right thing to do namely to “seek the hand of God” and tell other people that Lecrae is himself incapable of always doing the right thing.\nHopefully seek the hand of God\nand tell ’em that he’s incapable Hand of God “Hopefully seek the hand of God and tell ’em that he’s incapable” \u003e Hand of God While Lecrae cannot be sure what he would actually do if he was placed in Kendrick’s position, he hopes that he would “seek the hand of God”.\nIn biblical literature, God’s “hand” symbolizes God’s ability to help, rescue and save his people from their enemies and any forces of evil who would try to enslave them.\nWith the Bible, this literary and symbolic reference to God’s hand is first used in a poetic song that the prophet Moses sang after God rescued the Israelite people out of slavery in Egypt, parted a sea for them to pass through to safety while drowning the Egyptian who were trying to re-enslave them.\nThen Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said,\n“I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously.\nHe has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.\nThe LORD is my strength and song.\nHe has become my salvation.\nThis is my God, and I will praise him;\nmy father’s God, and I will exalt him.\nThe LORD is a man of war.\nThe LORD is his name.\nHe has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea.\nHis chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.\nThe deeps cover them.\nThey went down into the depths like a stone.\nYour right hand, the LORD, is glorious in power.\nYour right hand, the LORD, dashes the enemy in pieces.\nIn the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you.\nYou send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.\nWith the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.\nThe floods stood upright as a heap.\nThe deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.\nThe enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder.\nMy desire will be satisfied on them.\nI will draw my sword. My hand will destroy them.’\nYou blew with your wind.\nThe sea covered them.\nThey sank like lead in the mighty waters.\nWho is like you, the LORD, among the gods?\nWho is like you, glorious in holiness,\nfearful in praises, doing wonders?\nYou stretched out your right hand.\nThe earth swallowed them.\nYou, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed.\nYou have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.\n-Exodus 15:1-13 The story and poetry of God rescuing the Israelite people from slavery constantly emphasizes the fact that God’s people are meant to fully rely on God’s power rather than relying on their own power. In many cases, God’s people are must learn to rely on God in situations where relying on their own power would require them to use their hands for violence against their human enemies.\nThe importance of being humble enough to rely on the hand of God rather than using one’s own hands to commit acts of violence is further emphasized by Jesus and his disciples in the New Testament, most notably in chapter 4 of the letter from St. James.\nWhere do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members? You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.\n-James 4:1-10 It is notable that Kendrick specifically refers to chapter 4 of St. James’s letter on the song “LUST.”.\nLately, in James 4:4 says\n“Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord” I’m incapable “Hopefully seek the hand of God and tell ’em that he’s incapable” \u003e I’m incapable Lecrae continues to refer to himself in the third person as he seems to hope that if he was in Kendrick’s position he would tell people that he is incapable of consistently making the right choice or living up to Jesus’s example of sacrifical love. But truthfully, I’m nobody to judge Judge “But truthfully, I’m nobody to judge” \u003e Judge Lecrae’s self-awareness and humility lead him to conclude that he does not possess moral integrity that would make him qualified to judge others.\nDespite the anger that Lecrae has justifiably expressed toward the drug dealers, music industry labels, crooked doctors, fake tough rappers and fake deep gurus, Lecrae is simultaneously aware that he would be a hypocrite to pass judgement and condemn these people without expecting to face judgment himself and be condemned for his own acts of injustice.\nLecrae’s reluctance to judge or condemn others is likely inspired by a passage from Jesus’s most influential set of teachings. In this passage Jesus warns people that they will be judged by the same standard by which they judge others. Jesus also spoke against hypocrites who point out the small wrongdoings of another person while they are blinded by their own much more significant wrongdoings.\nDon’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.\nWhy do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam of wood that is in your own eye? Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.\n-Matthew 7:1-5 My good deeds are like some period blood stains\non a dirty rug Period blood stains “My good deeds are like some period blood stains on a dirty rug” \u003e Period blood stains Lecrae continues to acknowledge his shortcomings by saying saying that even the good deeds that he has done have been so messed up by all of his evil deeds that his good deeds should be thrown out of consideration like a rug that had been stained by the discharge of blood and tissue during a woman’s menstrual period.\nHere Lecrae is alluding to a passage from Isaiah 64 where the prophet acknowledges the numerous sinful deeds of God’s people and compares their righteous deeds to an unclean menstrual rag which women of that time used during their periods.\nBehold, You were angry, for we sinned,\nWe continued this way for a long time;\nHow shall we be saved?\nFor we have all become like one who is unclean,\nall our righteous deads are like a menstrual rag.\nWe all wither like a leaf;\nour sins carry us away like the wind.\n-Isaiah 64:4-6 Within the spiritual tradition of the Israelites, menstrual blood and any other bodily discharge from men or women were also considered ritually unclean which meant that Israelites were not allowed to go near God’s temple until the discharge stopped.\nThe implication here is that Lecrae’s good deeds have been so deeply affected by his evil deeds that based solely on his actions, he should not expect to be allowed to serve God or be on a mission as a Christian rapper.\nAll that I can offer them is Jesus’ love Jesus’ love “All that I can offer them is Jesus’ love” \u003e Jesus’ love Despite believing that he “deserves death” and believing that his good deeds are unacceptable due to his evil deeds, Lecrae also believes that he has rececived a new kind of life because of the unconditional love from God the Father and Jesus, the Son of God. Here Lecrae is likely inspired by Jesus’s words in the Gospel according to St. John’s account of the Gospel, where Jesus states that God’s love for the world motivated God to send Jesus into the world to give humans an opportunity to have “eternal life.”\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.\n-John 3:16-17 Having personally experienced the transformative power of Jesus’s love, Lecrae now offers Jesus’s love to those who suffered due to the evil deeds of others and also offers Jesus’s love to the enemies who have committed the evil deeds that caused people to suffer.\nHere Lecrae seems to be following one of the commands in Jesus’s most famous set of teachings, which specifically instructed Jesus’s disciple to love their enemies because God the Father graciously loved those who did good deeds and those who did evil deeds.\nYou have heard that it was said, “You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.” But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust, the righteous and the unrighteous.\n-Matthew 5:43-45 Meanwhile, by offering Jesus’s love to those who have suffered from the evil deeds of others Lecrae seems to be aligned with New Testament writers such as St. Paul who were able to endure and even rejoice in the midst of suffering because of Jesus’s love.\nWe also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope; and hope doesn’t disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.\n-Romans 5:3-5\nWho shall separate us from the love of [Christ / the anointed one]? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\nEven as it is written:\n“For your sake we are killed all day long.\nWe were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”\nNo, in all these things, we are more than overcomers through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor demons, nor elemental forces, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n-Romans 8:35-39 I know it sound foolish to many, like\n‘Really? That’s all you got for us?’ Foolish “I know it sound foolish to many, like ‘Really? That’s all you got for us?’” \u003e Foolish Even as Lecrae offers Jesus’s love to people who have suffered or are wondering what Lecrae would do to address all the evil in the world, Lecrae is very much aware that many people will feel disappointed and underwhelmed with Lecrae’s offer. These people may then respond to Lecrae by saying, “Really? That’s all you got for us?”\nIn particular, Lecrae knows that these people will think that simply offering love is foolish because it likely won’t stop all the evil deeds that are causing people to suffer. Moreover, the idea of offering love to one’s enemies will seem absolutely foolish to most people\nIt should be noted that unlike the modern usage of the word “love”, within the teachings of Jesus and his followers, “love” does not primarily refer to a set of positive feelings or attraction to a person based on that delightful aspect of that person. Love also doesn’t mean having a close relationship. Instead, love tends to refer to actions that one does so that another person can love a good life, which in many cases might involve actions that help another person to stop doing things that are evil and destructive. Nonetheless, the story of Jesus life, death and resurrection in the Gospel accounts of the New Testament is primarily a story about how Jesus loved his friends and enemies so much that he was willing to die for them to live a good life. This is a point made by St. Paul in his letter to the Church in Rome.\nFor while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous person; though perhaps for the good person someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n-Romans 5:6-8 Most notably, Jesus showed love for enemies when he showed empathy for the ignorance of the people who were crucifying him and asked God the Father to forgive them as he was hanging on the cross.\nWhen they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified Jesus there… Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”\n-Luke 23:33-34 Yeah, the cross is foolish to the perishin' Foolish to the perishing “Yeah, the cross is foolish to the perishin’” \u003e Foolish to the perishing By saying “the cross is foolish to the perishing” Lecrae is quoting from a passage in St. Paul’s first letter to the Church in the Greek city of Corinth. In that passage St. Paul acknowledges that Jesus’s death on the cross must seem foolish from the perspective of non-Christians who made choices based on the supposed wisdom of Greek philosophy.\nFor the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.”\nWhere is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn’t God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe. For Judeans ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Judeans, and foolishness to Greeks, but to those who are called, both Judeans and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God; because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\nFor you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble; but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong. God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that do not exist, that he might bring to nothing the things that exist, so that no fleshly creature should boast before God. Because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and holiness, and redemption: that, as it is written, “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”\n-1 Corinthians 1:18-30 Lecrae is acknowledging that most people who make choices based on the supposed wisdom of modern, secular philosophy will think that it was foolish for Jesus to love and forgive those who hung him on the cross, particularly if Jesus had the power and influence to have his followers fight and kill to prevent him from dying on the cross.\nHowever, St. Matthew’s Gospel account of Jesus being betrayed and arrested specifically highlights the fact that Jesus refused to have his disciples take up swords to fight against the betrayer or the opposing soldiers. Moreover, Jesus refrained from using his authority to call an army of angels to use supernatural force against his human adversaries. Jesus told his disciples that those who live by the sword will die by the sword.\nThen he came to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?”\n-Matthew 26:45-53 Moreover, by saying this is foolish specifically from the perspective of “the perishing” (aka those who are dying), Lecrae seems to be pointing out that Jesus dying on the cross seems foolish to mortal humans who do not truly believe in life after death and thus feel that it it necessary to protect their lives by any means necessary even if that means committing acts of violence against one’s enemies.\nIn his first letter to the church in the Greek city of Corinth, St. Paul also asserts Jesus’s death on the cross along with Jesus’s teachings on love and forgiveness would be worthless if Jesus did not actually resurrect from the dead or if Jesus’s followers would not actually be resurrected from the dead in the future.\nNow if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, your faith also is in vain. Moreover, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have hoped in Christ only in this life, we are of all people most to be pitied.\nIf the dead are not raised, let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\n-1 Corinthians 15:12-19, 32 Lecrae thus seems to recognize that the love which Jesus showed in the cross will not make sense to people who do not believe the Gospel announcement of Jesus’s resurrection. Such people are more likely to agree with the approach of using violence to eliminate people who pose a threat to society just like Kendrick advocated throughout “Watch the Party Die”.\nThe world’ll call me weak and the saints’ll say I embarrass ’em The world’ll call me weak “The world’ll call me weak and the saints’ll say I embarrass ’em” \u003e The world’ll call me weak Because Lecrae hopes to offer Jesus’s love and refrain from using his strength to take violent actions against one’s enemies, Lecrae perceives that people in “the world” will call him “weak” and dismiss whatever he has to say.\nBy saying “the world”, Lecrae seems to be alluding to a biblical concept in which “the world” refers to the prideful, contentious and unforgiving way that humans tend to live when they do not humble themselves by trusting in God’s goodness and provision. The use of this term is best illustrated in the fourth chapter of the letter from St. James.\nWhere do the wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your members? You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires.\nYou adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.”\n-James 4:1-10 It is notable that at the end of the track “LUST.” from DAMN. Kendrick alluded to the biblical concept of “the world” and specifically referenced the fourth chapter of the letter of St. James.\nLately, in James 4:4, friend of the world is enemy of the Lord.\nBrace yourself. Lust is all yours. It is also notable that “BLOOD.”, the first track on DAMN., opens with an ominous voice which implies that weakness is the only other choice if one does not want to choose wickedness.\nIs it wickedness or is it weakness.\nYou decide.\nAre we going to live or die? The choice between wickedness and weakness is a recurring motif throughout DAMN., culminating in Kendrick’s breakthrough moment during “FEAR.”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me involve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive Lecrae and Kendrick’s recognition that they need to embrace weakness in order to follow God is likely influenced by a passage from St. Paul’s second letter to the church in Corinth. In that passage. St. Paul writes about God allowed St. Paul to ensure a physical illness so that he would not become proud and so that he would learn that one must embrace one’s own weakness in order to be empowered by God’s strength.\nI wil not boast on my own behalf, except in my weaknesses. For if I would like to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.\nBecause of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, so that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, so that I should not be exalted excessively. Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me. The Lord has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”\nMost gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me. Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.\n-2 Corinthians 12:5-10 In addition to people in “the world” thinking that Lecrae is weak, Lecrae also says that “the saints” will think that Lecrae is embarassing them.\nThe word “saint” means “holy person”, where the word “holy” refers to somone or something that is set apart of a unique purpose and is a source of life for others. In several of the New Testament letters, the church leader who wrote the letter addresses members of the chuch as “saints” or more specifially as “those who are called to be saints”.\nDespite the fact that Christians are called to be holy people who are a source of life to others, Lecrae seems to be alluding to criticism that he perceives he will receive from many conservative Christians who want Lecrae to publically judge and condemn the people in “the world” who they think are behaving in ways that are evil or detrimental to society. If Lecrae does not publicalyl judge and condemn people engaged in such evil behavior, Lecrae perceives that this particular set of Christians will think that Lecrae is being to friendly with “the world” and thus is an embarassment to all Chrisitans.\nI walk through valleys full of evil, I’m aware of it Valleys full of evil “I walk through valleys full of evil, I’m aware of it” \u003e Valleys full of evil Here Lecrae seems to be speaking directly to the “saints” who will say that Lecrae embarasses them and concedes that he walks “through the valleys full of evil”. By saying this Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that his mission has led him to work in close proximity to people who have turned away from the goodness of God and turned towards evil. For Lecrae, these “valleys” may represent various non-Christian environments including the music industry and mainstream hip hop culture.\nLecrae also seems to be alluding to Psalm 23 which is a poem written by King David to reflect on how God guides him through evil environments like a shepherd guides his sheep through dark, deadly valleys. The implication would be that Lecrae trusts God to help him navigate through the evils of the music industry and mainstream hip hop culture so that he can fulfill the mission that God has given him.\nThe LORD is my shepherd:\nI will lack nothing.\nHe makes me lie down in green pastures.\nHe leads me beside still waters.\nHe restores my soul.\nHe guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.\nEven though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\nI will fear no evil, for you are with me.\nYour rod and your staff, they comfort me\nYou prepare a table in front of me in the presence of my enemies\nYou anoint my head with oil\nMy cup overflows\nSurlely goodness and loyal love will follow me all the days of my life\nAnd I will live in the house of the LORD forever\n-Psalm 23:1-4 I can’t condemn the world and burn all of the heretics Condemened to burning “I can’t condemn the world and burn all of the heretics” \u003e Condemened to burning As Lecrae responds to Christians who want him to judge people in the “valleys full of evil”, Lecrae seems to argue that way for him to condemn “the world” while being faithful to the mission that God has given him.\nLecrae is likely convinced that he cannot or really should not condemn “the world” because St. John’s account of the Gospel specifically highlights that God sent Jesus on a mission not to condemn “the world”.\nFor God so loved the world that He gave his one and only born son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.\n-John 3:16-17 Lecrae further highlights the infeasibility of condemning the world by saying that he can’t “burn all of the heretics”.\nWithin the English-speaking world, the word “heretic” has historically referred to someone who was a member of a church or a citizen of a pre-modern Christian nation who insists on spreading ideas that seems to go against the Bible, teachings of Jesus or the interpretations of the church.\nIn the case of pre-modern, Christian nations, it was not uncommon for heretics to be burned to death or receive some other form of capital punishment. Burning heretics was often justified as a way to prevent dangerous ideas from spreading and causing detrimental effects on society.\nThis logical justification for burning heretics is essentially identical to the logic that Kendrick used to justify executing various people throughout “Watch the Party Die”, most notably when Kendrick said “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time”.\nBecause burning all the heretics did not stop ideas from spreading, did not preserve societal harmony and is now considered unthinkable in a modern, pluralistic, democratic society, Lecrae seems to be pointing out that condemning the world is totally infeasible and undesirable, even if he is incensed by modern heritics like the “fake deep gurus pushin’ voodoo on the people, tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real”.\nLove is patient so I’m trustin’ in the narrative Love is patient “Love is patient so I’m trustin’ in the narrative” \u003e Love is patient After stating that he “can’t condemn the world and burn all of the heretics”, Lecrae once again emphasizes that he hopes to offer people Jesus’s love.\nBecause the word “love” can mean different things to different people in different contexts, Lecrae describes one of the core attributes of Jesus’s love by saying that “love is patient”.\nLecrae is likely referencing a passage from St. Paul’s letter to the Church in the Greek city of Corinth. In that passage, St. Paul tries to teach the members of the Church that love is not about strong emotions or ecstatic experiences or sex. Instead, Paul describes love as a set of virtues that lead to right relationships.\nIf I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong, or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.\nLove is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or proud or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; love is not irritable or resentful; love does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.\nBut where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.\nBut now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love.\n-1 Corinthians 13:1-8,13 Additionally, Lecrae may also be inspired by a passage from the second letter from St. Peter which explains that God is patient because he wants to give humans more time and opportunities to repent so that they do not keep going down a path that will lead to their own death and destruction.\nThe Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but he is patient with us, not wishing that anyone should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\n-2 Peter 3:9 God’s patience to prevent humans from dying contrasts sharply with the impatience that Kendrick displayed when he said that “I think it’s time to watch the party die.”\nThe idea that offering Jesus’s love will require him to be patient with humans who “love to do evil” may lead to a lot of doubts about whether God will address the evil and injustice that continues to go on in parties throughout the world. However, rather than being overcome with doubt, Lecrae says that he is “trusting in the narrative”.\nBiblical narrative “Love is patient so I’m trustin’ in the narrative” \u003e Biblical narrative The idea that offering Jesus’s love will require him to be patient with humans who “love to do evil” may lead to a lot of doubts about whether God will address the evil and injustice that continues to go on in parties throughout the world. However, rather than being overcome with doubt, Lecrae says that he is “trusting in the narrative.”\nHere Lecrae seems to be referring to the “biblical narrative”, or the overarching flow of events that are recounted over the course of the Bible.\nIn summary, the biblical narrative tells the story of how…\nGod created the world and gave humans the responsibility of ruling the world on God’s behalf.\nHowever, instead of ruling by God’s definition of good, humans redefined good and evil based on their own limited perspective, which led to broken trust and broken relationships in families and in society.\nGod promised that one day a human would come to rule the world based on God’s definition of good and resist the temptation to rule on his terms.\nNumerous characters were given the opportunity to rule but eventually started to rule on their own terms which leads to a world of violence and injustice.\nAfter so many failed leaders, God the Father sent Jesus as the Son of God from heaven down to earth to speak and act in a way that would show humans how to rule by God’s definition of good, even when doing so led his enemies to kill him.\nJesus then resurrected from the dead to show that following God’s definition of God leads to a new kind of life that will endure beyond physical death.\nJesus instructed his disciples to spread his teachings, the example of way of life and the surprising announcement of his death and resurrection to people from nations all over the world so that they could turn towards what is good and turn away from what is evil.\nJesus then ascended back up into the heavens and told his disciples to be patient and wait for the day when Jesus will back to earth to rid the world of evil once and for all. Lecrae seems to see himself in that final section of the narrative where he must be patient and wait for Jesus to come back, rid the world of evil, and finally put an end to the “party”.\nThis idea of being patient and waiting for Jesus to come back to earth and bring a resolution to the narrative is something that Kendrick also expressed during DAMN.’s breakthrough moment on the track “FEAR.”\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin’ for resolutions until somebody get back And Christ ain't watch the party die\nHe died instead of it Die for the party “And Christ ain’t watch the party die, He died instead of it” \u003e Die for the party Lecrae ends his verse by flipping the phrase “Watch the Party Die” and declaring that Jesus is the anointed king (aka Christ) who died instead of the party.\nThis final line is thus a restatement of the track’s title “Die for the Party”.\nThe idea of Jesus Christ dying for “the party” echoes St. Paul’s words from his letter to the Church in Rome where he taught that Jesus is the anointed king (aka Christ) who died on behalf of sinners (i.e. people who failed to act in a way that would create justice and right relationships) at the right time.\nFor while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a good person someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n-Romans 5:6-8 This idea of Jesus dying in the place of a sinner is also vividly depicted during the scene of Jesus’s trial in St. John’s account of the Gospel. In that scene, the Roman governor determined that Jesus was not guilty of any crime under Roman law. However, because the Judean leaders wanted to kill Jesus, the Roman governor offered to release a man who was guilty of armed robbery and leading a violent revolt against the occupying Romans and have Jesus die in place of the rebel leader.\nPilate, the Roman governor, came out again to the Judeans and said to them, “I find no grounds at all for charges in His case. However, you have a custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover; therefore do you wish that I release for you the King of the Judeans?”\nThen the Judeans shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a [rebel / revolutionary / robber].\nThen Pilate, the Roman governor, took Jesus and had Jesus flogged. And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head, and put a purple cloak on Him; and they repeatedly came up to Him and said, “Hail, King of the Judeans!” and slapped Him in the face again and again.\n-John 18:38-40 Hence, with this final line, Lecrae is saying that Jesus died so that killers, evil doers, abusers, liars, scammers, vultures, degenerates, drug dealers, crooked doctors, fake tough rappers, fake deep gurus and everyone else that Kendrick and Lecrae might have wanted to die do not actually have to die.\nRather than being the time to watch the party die, God seems to be giving these people some additional time to turn away from evil, turn towards the goodness of God and begin a new way of life before the party really has to end.\n",

</ul>
<p>On September 11, 2025, <strong>Kendrick Lamar shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_y8-rrS5La/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram post</a></strong> that features a tightly cropped photo of a <strong>pair of black Air Force 1 shoes</strong> and an untitled new song with three verses and a hook. The first and second verse begin with the words &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to watch the party die&rdquo; which would lead to it being referred to by the name <strong>&ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>The release of <strong>&ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; came four months after Kendrick released &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;</strong>, the diss track which eventually went on to win five Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; led to Kendrick being almost unanimously declared the winner of the rap battle with Drake by relentlessly attacking Drake&rsquo;s reputation and popularizing an accusation that Drake is a pedophile.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Say, Drake, I hear you like &rsquo;em young</strong><br>
You better not ever go to cell block one<br>
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love<br>
Just make sure you hide your lil&rsquo; sister from him<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Why you trollin&rsquo; like a bitch? Ain&rsquo;t you tired?<br>
Tryna strike a chord and it&rsquo;s probably <strong>A minor</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The release of <strong>&ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; also came two months before the release of Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>GNX</em></strong>, where Kendrick&rsquo;s animosity against Drake seems to expand to anyone who aligns themselves with Drake by not giving Kendrick the respect and loyalty that Kendrick believes he deserves.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It <strong>used to be fuck that nigga</strong>, but <strong>now it&rsquo;s plural<br>
Fuck everybody</strong>, that&rsquo;s on my body<br>
My blick first, then God got me<br>
&hellip;<br>
They like, &ldquo;Dot big trippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; <strong>I just want what I deserve</strong><br>
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it&rsquo;s over with<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; what COVID did, they&rsquo;ll never get over it<br>
&hellip;<br>
Okay, nigga, let&rsquo;s settle it, these <strong>niggas been fake loyal</strong><br>
Since y&rsquo;all pandering to <strong>choose a side</strong>, let me do it for you<br>
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, <strong>I watched the party just die</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
<strong>Exterminate &rsquo;em right now</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; thus serves as a bridge between Kendrick&rsquo;s battle with Drake and Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>GNX</em>. Thematically, &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; seems to offer an important perspective on the battle and the album as the track seems to implicitly ask a deeply philosophical question: <strong>What should we as a society do to humans who perpetrate evil or enable others to perpetrate evil?</strong></p>
<p>If we are to take the battle, &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and <em>GNX</em> at face value, the answer to this question would seem to be that we should &ldquo;exterminate them right now&rdquo;. However, on the final verse of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, <strong>Kendrick&rsquo;s deeply held Christian beliefs briefly come to the surface as he wonders what Christian hip hop artist Lecrae would want us to do</strong> to humans who perpetrate evil or enable others to perpetrate evil.</p>
<p>On September 14, three days after Kendrick&rsquo;s Instagram post, <strong>Lecrae shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_6xvJxg8Cr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram post</a></strong> that features a tightly cropped photo of a <strong>pair of white Air Force 1 shoes</strong> and an untitled new song in which Lecrae raps a verse to a modified version of the beat from Kendrick&rsquo;s post. The song—which was later released under the title <strong>&ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;</strong>—serves as Lecrae’s response to Kendrick wondering what Lecrae would do.</p>
<p>The contrast between the black Air Force 1 shoes in Kendrick&rsquo;s post and the white Air Force 1 shoes in Lecrae&rsquo;s post emphasizes the idea that <strong>&ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die For the Party&rdquo; represent two opposing perspectives on how we should respond to human evil</strong>.</p>
<p>With 2024 being a year in which Kendrick won five Grammy Awards by accusing Drake of being a pedophile, Diddy was arrested and charged with sex trafficking, college campuses were shut down due to protests against Israel&rsquo;s alleged genocide in Gaza, the elected U.S. president was routinely compared to Hitler, and much of the internet celebrated the murder of a health insurance CEO, it seems well worth the time to go through a deep, <strong>line-by-line analysis of Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and Lecrae&rsquo;s &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;</strong>, which is what this blog post aims to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham, who is better known by his middle name, Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams,” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dear <strong>Aubrey</strong><br>
I know you probably thinkin&rsquo; I wanted to <strong>crash your party</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first line of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick&rsquo;s battle with Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra, sit down, what I&rsquo;m about to say is heavy, now listen<br>
Mm-mm, your son&rsquo;s a sick man with sick thoughts, <strong>I think niggas like him should die</strong><br>
<strong>Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life</strong><br>
He <strong>hates Black women, hypersexualizes &rsquo;em with kinks of a nympho fetish</strong><br>
Grew facial hair because he understood bein&rsquo; a beard just fit him better<br>
<strong>He got sex offenders on ho-VO</strong> that he keep on a monthly allowance<br>
A <strong>child should never be compromised</strong> and he keepin&rsquo; his child around them<br>
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin&rsquo; <strong>there&rsquo;s predators like him lurkin&rsquo;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>They be streamlinin&rsquo; victims all inside of they home</strong> and callin&rsquo; &rsquo;em tender<br>
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong><br>
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away<br>
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away<br>
They lookin&rsquo; at you too if you standin&rsquo; by him, keep the family away<br>
I&rsquo;m <strong>lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In these lyrics from &ldquo;meet the grahams,&rdquo; Kendrick asserts that sexual predators like Drake or Harvey Weinstein should die, much like the party in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also recounts a message from Black comedian Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth.” Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview, which was released by the <em>Club Shay Shay</em> podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these predatory practices.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Years before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offenses and given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since, at the time, Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assault but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=iKsx-nqFoDQbiOnu&amp;t=940">interview (15:40 - 16:32)</a>, Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I came in this business saying I was going to expose</strong>. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. <strong>It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s side and the other side</strong> and we don&rsquo;t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. <strong>All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024</strong>. It&rsquo;s up for all of them. <strong>It don&rsquo;t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is</strong>. TD Jakes - any of them the every…<strong>All lies will be exposed</strong>. That&rsquo;s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. <strong>The truth is the light</strong>.<br>
&hellip;<br>
All people that love the truth got to be happy if <strong>the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That&rsquo;s just what time it is - 2024</strong>, folks.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&amp;t=6033">interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)</a>, Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy&rsquo;s parties, and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities, he consistently refused to attend because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis</strong>. That was my only goal.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve had to turn down $50 million four times</strong> - four times - just <strong>to protect my integrity and that virgin hole</strong> I was telling you about, right. Cause <strong>P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong> You&rsquo;ve got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I did.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by saying “I think <em>it’s time</em> to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with—or maybe fulfilling—Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, the idea that it is almost &ldquo;time&rdquo; for the criminal offenses of Drake and his crew to be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; when he predicted a police raid on Drake&rsquo;s mansion, which is nicknamed &ldquo;The Embassy.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick would go on to release the album <em>GNX</em>, featuring the opening track “wacced out murals,” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that the truth is about to be exposed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
Exterminate &rsquo;em right now<br>
<strong>Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth &lsquo;bout to get loud</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized, allegations.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14-year-old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31-year-old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently, including Drake sending a message that said, “I miss you so much,” to which she replied, “I miss you more.” She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year later, in 2019, roughly five years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes &rsquo;em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next five years.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Dude R. Kelly got away”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake&rsquo;s gonna be …he&rsquo;s on that R. Kelly tip.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
“You think so?”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Drizzy <strong>Drake likes &rsquo;em young</strong>. He does. It&rsquo;s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; Drake, Drizzy <strong>Drake is into the young ones</strong>. <strong>He&rsquo;s going to get got in the next 5 years</strong>, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.&rdquo;</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us.” In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party,” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Say, <strong>Drake, I hear you like &rsquo;em young</strong><br>
You better not ever go to cell block one<br>
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love<br>
Just <strong>make sure you hide your lil&rsquo; sister from him</strong><br>
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs<br>

      <h4 id="i-think-its-time-to-watch-the-party-die--perverting-gods-plan">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to watch the party die&rdquo; &gt; Perverting God&rsquo;s plan<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-think-its-time-to-watch-the-party-die--perverting-gods-plan">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pedophilia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex, due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Devil is a lie, he a 69 God</strong>, ayy<br>
&hellip;<br>
The family matter and the truth of the matter<br>
<strong>It was God&rsquo;s plan to show y&rsquo;all the liar</strong><br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a<br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament, the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;diabolical one,&rdquo; &ldquo;false accuser,&rdquo; or &ldquo;liar&rdquo;)—also known as the &ldquo;satan&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;adversary&rdquo;)—is often depicted as a figure who, unlike God, cannot actually create anything. Instead, the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; will take things that have been created by the one true God and use lies to twist or turn them upside down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his viral <em>Club Shay Shay</em> interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>These people are not powerful. <strong>Satan can&rsquo;t create anything</strong> that includes blessings for his people. That&rsquo;s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn&rsquo;t happen. They all do the same job.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In English, the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; or someone who behaves like the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing toward an evil purpose. The word &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; is derived from the Latin word “perverto,” which means “to turn thoroughly.” Someone who habitually &ldquo;perverts&rdquo; good things can themselves be referred to with the noun &ldquo;pervert.&rdquo; Notably, Kendrick referred to Drake as a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; on &ldquo;meet the grahams.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any <strong>pervert</strong> that lives, keep the family safe</em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake—the self-proclaimed “6 god”—has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan,” in reference to Drake&rsquo;s hit single.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God.” This pattern of lying is first depicted when the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; takes on the form of a snake, which deceives the prototypical man and woman into eating the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now <strong>the snake was more shrewd</strong> than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he <strong>said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?</strong>”<br>
 <br>
The woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but <strong>from the fruit of the tree</strong> which is in the middle of the garden, <strong>God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die</strong>.’”<br>
 <br>
The snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and <strong>you will become like God</strong>, knowing good and evil.”<br>
 <br>
When the <strong>woman saw that the tree</strong> was good for food, and that it <strong>was a delight to the eyes</strong>, and that the tree <strong>was desirable</strong> to make one wise, <strong>she took some of its fruit and ate</strong>; and she also <strong>gave some to her husband with her, and he ate</strong>.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Kendrick&rsquo;s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to represent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <h4 id="i-think-its-time-to-watch-the-party-die--sex-god">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to watch the party die&rdquo; &gt; Sex god<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-think-its-time-to-watch-the-party-die--sex-god">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to sexual acts, Kendrick seems to be depicting Drake as a “sex god.” In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus, and Liber were worshiped throughout the world, including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East, where most of the events of the Bible take place.<br>
 </li>
<li>In many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and  destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After the release of &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Like Us,&rdquo; Drake released “The Heart Part 6,” where Drake publicly denied the pedophilia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick&rsquo;s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick&rsquo;s track &ldquo;mother i sober&rdquo; from <strong>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</strong>. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.</p>

      <h4 id="this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wickedness-or-weakness">&ldquo;This shit done got too wicked to apologize&rdquo; &gt; Wickedness or weakness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wickedness-or-weakness">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be asserting that &ldquo;the party&rdquo; has become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending &ldquo;the party&rdquo; have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties, which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with <strong>sex trafficking, racketeering,</strong> and <strong>transportation to engage in prostitution</strong>. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry, as exposed by Katt Williams.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album <em>DAMN.</em>. The album&rsquo;s opening track, &ldquo;BLOOD.,&rdquo; begins with an ominous voice that says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it <strong>wickedness</strong> or is it <strong>weakness</strong>?<br>
You decide. Are we going to <strong>live</strong> or <strong>die</strong>?”</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; that is routinely perpetrated by powerful, violent men in this world and the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; that was exhibited by Jesus, who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Love&rsquo;s gonna get you killed<br>
But pride&rsquo;s gonna be the death of you, and you and me</em><br>
-&ldquo;PRIDE.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Damn, love or lust<br>
Damn, all of us</em><br>
-&ldquo;LOVE&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Hail Mary, <strong>Jesus</strong>, and Joseph<br>
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives<br>
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters<br>

<strong>It&rsquo;s murder</strong> on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
<strong>Homicidal thoughts</strong>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br>
But <strong>is America honest or do we bask in sin?</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;XXX.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; creativity<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of missin&rsquo; out on you and me<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; loyalty from pride<br>
&lsquo;Cause my DNA won&rsquo;t let me involve in the light of God<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that my humbleness is gone<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that love ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; here no more<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, <strong>fear that it&rsquo;s wickedness or weakness</strong><br>
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive<br>
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
And I can&rsquo;t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse<br>
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br>

Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>

Damn</em><br>
-&ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that throughout <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from the way of <strong>wickedness</strong> would require him to turn towards Jesus&rsquo;s way of <strong>weakness</strong>, it is ironic that throughout &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultaneously building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible</summary>
    
      <h4 id="this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">&ldquo;This shit done got too wicked to apologize&rdquo; &gt; Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive, and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at &ldquo;the party&rdquo; are &ldquo;too wicked to apologize.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in <strong>Genesis 19</strong>, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men who are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels from getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone, and the city soon gets destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in <strong>Judges 19-21</strong>, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor&rsquo;s wife leads to a civil war where thousands of men are killed. The war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed to capture teenage girls from a festival celebration and force them into marriage.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in <strong>2 Samuel 11</strong>, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses, and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David is immediately overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman&rsquo;s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah, who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David&rsquo;s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah, and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace, where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba is pregnant, he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child, he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae references this story of King David&rsquo;s sexual misconduct with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah on &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo; when he raps:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>But when I take a look in the mirror<br>
The <strong>blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer</strong><br>
Who <strong>had Bathsheba in his quarters</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>God soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51, in which King David acknowledges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, despite King David&rsquo;s repentance, the son that was born from King David&rsquo;s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover, later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David&rsquo;s second son—who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped—executed a plot to murder the oldest son. King David&rsquo;s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to rape all of King David’s lower-status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the major lessons of King David&rsquo;s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real-world consequences for David, his family, and the whole society around King David.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick released the track &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)&rdquo; where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David, and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>With a Bible and rifle</strong>: I play the game as I &ldquo;blam-blaow!&rdquo;<br>
Holler back at me, nigga<br>
And if they said that I&rsquo;m the one, why you asking me, nigga?<br>
&lsquo;Cause when the whole world see you as &lsquo;Pac reincarnated<br>
<strong>Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David<br>
And pray to God that you make it</strong> or live your life in The Matrix<br>
&lsquo;Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it&rsquo;s quite contagious</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Kendrick knows the story of King David&rsquo;s wicked behavior and subsequent apology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy, or any of the men who have participated in &ldquo;the party&rdquo; can ever truly apologize or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others whom he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that would allow him to justify the use of violence to eliminate his enemies or those whom he considers to be an enemy of society, which is exactly what he does throughout the rest of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be suggesting that the wickedness of the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; is on a totally different level than other negative behavior or even criminal offenses that could be considered forgivable. From Kendrick&rsquo;s perspective, this different level of wickedness seems to justify getting these partygoers &ldquo;wacced&rdquo; and &ldquo;disqualified.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Wacced&rdquo; is slang for destroyed, defaced, or disrespected.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of the word &ldquo;wacced&rdquo; would go on to become more notable a few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; when Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em>, which opens with the track &ldquo;wacced out murals.&rdquo; On &ldquo;wacced out murals,&rdquo; Kendrick expresses anger after an unknown graffiti vandalizer &ldquo;wacced out&rdquo; a mural on the side of a Compton restaurant that a visual artist had created to honor Kendrick. The vandalism included Kendrick&rsquo;s face covered with the letters &ldquo;OVO,&rdquo; in reference to Drake&rsquo;s OVO crew and record label, which is an acronym for &ldquo;October&rsquo;s Very Own.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Yesterday, somebody wacced out my mural</strong><br>
That energy&rsquo;ll make you niggas move to Europe<br>
But it&rsquo;s regular for me, yeah, that&rsquo;s for sure<br>
The <strong>love and hate is definite</strong> without a cure</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqflSI6KIoE">video</a> of the vandalizer spraying graffiti on Kendrick&rsquo;s mural was first posted to social media on September 8, 2024, just three days before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die.&rdquo; One could reasonably suppose that the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; on September 11 was partially a response to Kendrick&rsquo;s mural getting vandalized.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One can also reasonably argue that “wacced out murals” is essentially a simplified spiritual successor to “Watch the Party Die.” &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo; seems crafted to allow listeners to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the vitriol of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; without having to closely <strong>analyze</strong> the lyrics and discover the double entendres. This connection can be seen in the verses of “wacced out murals,” where Kendrick threatens to “eliminate” anyone who is on “the other side” (i.e., not on God’s side). The third verse, in particular, also contains a direct reference to “Watch the Party Die” and to Katt Williams calling for the truth to be exposed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it&rsquo;s plural<br>
<strong>Fuck everybody</strong>, that&rsquo;s on my body<br>
<strong>My blick first</strong>, then God got me<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>This is not for lyricists</strong>, I swear it&rsquo;s not the sentiments<br>
<strong>Fuck a double entendre, I want y&rsquo;all to feel this shit</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Okay, nigga, let&rsquo;s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal<br>
Since y&rsquo;all pandering to <strong>choose a side</strong>, let me do it for you<br>
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, <strong>I watched the party just die</strong><br>
Niggas cackling about— while all of y&rsquo;all is on trial<br>
&hellip;<br>
Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
<strong>Exterminate &rsquo;em right now</strong><br>
<strong>Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth &lsquo;bout to get loud</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I know propaganda work for them, and <strong>fuck whoever that&rsquo;s close to them</strong><br>
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein&rsquo; groomed, <strong>slide on both of them</strong></em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone is typically &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; from an activity or competition when they are exposed for lying, cheating, or behaving in a way that is illegal or unethical. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick could be saying that rappers like Drake should be disqualified from the “rap game” or, more specifically, from the competition of being considered the greatest rapper.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, based on the violent language throughout “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick might also be claiming that the hosts and attendees of “the party” should be disqualified from the most basic activity of living life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kendrick seems to indicate that he and the people associated with him have already decided to kill anyone who is guilty of killing someone innocent.<br>
 </li>
<li>The first three lines of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; have expressed significant amounts of animosity and vitriol. However, this fourth line is the first instance where Kendrick explicitly advocates for death sentences and targeted executions as an act of vigilante justice, where an individual or group without any legal authority decides to take the law into their own hands in order to punish offenders or address perceived injustices. Within the context of this track, Kendrick is establishing himself as the judge and jury while enlisting his supporters to join him as executioners.<br>
 </li>
<li>The idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” brings up a longstanding political, sociological, and philosophical debate about the best way to respond to potential wrongdoing, establish justice, and maintain an orderly society. Within this large debate, it should be noted that more than 50 countries, including the United States of America, currently execute individuals who have been convicted of a crime that the justice system considers particularly egregious or destabilizing to social order.<br>
 </li>
<li>In America, crimes that are eligible for the death penalty tend to be ones that involve intentionally or unintentionally killing someone innocent, whether through murder, terrorism, kidnapping, sexual assault, or drug trafficking. In contrast, European countries in the European Union have abolished the death penalty as a punishment for crimes. However, historically, most civilizations in human history have had some form of the death penalty, often for crimes that did not involve killing anyone—including theft, adultery, sexual misbehavior, disrespecting a member of a higher class, and speaking against the state government or the state religion.<br>
 </li>
<li>While America and many other modern nations still justify the use of death sentences after a fair trial, all modern nation-states—at least officially—oppose the use of individuals or groups taking the law into their own hands through vigilante justice. However, on an individual basis, many people do seem ready to accept, support, and even celebrate a vigilante execution that is carried out against someone whom they truly despise, even if that person has not broken any laws.</li>

<ul>
<li>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; this inclination for Americans to accept, support, and even celebrate vigilante executions came to the surface after a 26-year-old named Luigi Mangione gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a health insurance company. According to published excerpts from Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s writings, he claims to have targeted the UnitedHealthcare CEO due to his belief that UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies &ldquo;have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>Immediately after the shooting and even before his identity was uncovered, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/luigi-mangione-and-the-making-of-a-modern-antihero">Luigi Mangione became a kind of folk hero</a> as countless people across social media platforms expressed agreement with Mangione&rsquo;s assessment that &ldquo;these parasites simply had it coming&rdquo; and joined the shooter in expressing anger and vitriol against health insurance companies. This sentiment was so widely expressed that Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested, gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G-cPdWNiE">press conference</a> where he said, &ldquo;In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: he is no hero.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>On an international, geopolitical scale, the idea of it being justified and even necessary to &ldquo;kill the killers&rdquo; has also been expressed in the context of war. In 2024, much of this justification has come from many people on both sides of the Israel vs. Hamas conflict that began on October 7, 2023, eleven months before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; after Hamas killed 1,195 Israelis, took 248 Israelis as hostages, and—based on a few sources—sexually assaulted and gang raped numerous Israelis during the October 7 attack. Many people who supported the plight of the Palestinians justified the attack as a necessary response to how Israelis had previously killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Meanwhile, many supporters of Israel&rsquo;s War in Gaza justified killing the killers of innocent Israelis, even as tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed and two-thirds of Gaza&rsquo;s buildings were damaged or destroyed.<br>
 </li>
<li>While &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; does not specifically address current events such as the War in Gaza and was released months before Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s vigilante execution, both of these current events reveal the cultural zeitgeist in which Kendrick wrote, recorded, and released &ldquo;Watch the Party Die.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has explored the idea of killing the killers at length in his previous work, most notably on the track “XXX.” from <em>DAMN.</em> On the first verse of &ldquo;XXX.,&rdquo; Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) tells a story about a distressed friend who asked for advice on how to respond after gang members killed his son. Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) acknowledged that as an anointed (i.e., Christian) individual, he theoretically knew better but felt strongly that the friend should kill his son&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101<br>
Said <strong>they killed his only son</strong> because of insufficient funds<br>
He was sobbin&rsquo;, he was mobbin&rsquo;, way belligerent and drunk<br>
Talkin&rsquo; out his head, philosophin&rsquo; on what the Lord had done<br>
<strong>He said, &ldquo;K-Dot, can you pray for me?</strong> It been a fucked up day for me<br>
<strong>I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome&rdquo;</strong><br>
He was lookin&rsquo; for some closure, hopin&rsquo; I could bring him closer<br>
To the spiritual, <strong>my spirit do know better, but I told him</strong><br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sugarcoat the answer for you, <strong>this is how I feel</strong><br>
<strong>If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin&rsquo; killed</strong><br>
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of<br>
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch<br>
I wait in front a nigga&rsquo;s spot and watch him hit his block<br>
I catch a nigga leavin&rsquo; service if that&rsquo;s all I got<br>
<strong>I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong><br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that&rdquo;<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward<br>
I can&rsquo;t even keep the peace, <strong>don&rsquo;t you fuck with one of ours<br>
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, the second verse of &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; explored how the inclination toward violence and killing the killers is a common pattern of thought within the American psyche, in contrast to the mentality that was exemplified by Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hail Mary, <strong>Jesus</strong>, and Joseph<br>
The great <strong>American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives</strong><br>
<strong>Compulsive disorder</strong>, sons and daughters<br>
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us<br>
<strong>It&rsquo;s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
Homicidal thoughts</strong>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br>
But <strong>is America honest or do we bask in sin?</strong><br>
Pass the gin, <strong>I mix it with American blood<br>
Then bash him</strong> in, you Crippin&rsquo; or you married to Blood?<br>
I&rsquo;ll ask again, oops, accident<br>
It&rsquo;s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up<br>
<strong>You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us</strong><br>
<strong>Gang members or terrorists</strong>, et cetera, et cetera<br>
<strong>America&rsquo;s reflections of me</strong>, that&rsquo;s what a mirror does</em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that on “Worldwide Steppers” from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick asserted that we are all killers who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, cause the deaths of innocent people.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a killer, he&rsquo;s a killer, she&rsquo;s a killer</strong>, bitch<br>
<strong>We some killers</strong>, walkin&rsquo; zombies, tryna scratch that itch<br>
..<br>
<strong>Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers</strong><br>
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)<br>
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin&rsquo; philosophies<br>
You either gon&rsquo; be dead or in jail, <strong>killer psychology</strong><br>
Silent murderer, what&rsquo;s your body count? Who your sponsorship?<br>
Objectified so many bitches, <strong>I killed their confidence</strong> (What the—)<br>
The media&rsquo;s the new religion, <strong>you killed the consciousness</strong> (What the fuck?)<br>
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, <strong>you killed accomplishments</strong> (What the fuck?)<br>
<strong>Niggas killed freedom of speech</strong>, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)<br>
..<br>
<strong>I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community</strong><br>
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies<br>
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient<br>
But <strong>because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin&rsquo;</strong><br>
So what&rsquo;s the difference &rsquo;tween your life when hiding motives?<br>
More fatalities and reality bring you closure<br>
<strong>The noble person that goes to work and pray like they &lsquo;posed to?<br>
Slaughter people too, your murder&rsquo;s just a bit slower</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we apply the logic of &ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo; to this current line on &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; the natural conclusion would suggest that beyond the powerful men who exploit, coerce, and sexually abuse victims at parties, there is a much wider set of people whom Kendrick could justifiably kill through his vigilante executions.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, we should note that on “Worldwide Steppers,” Kendrick first and foremost acknowledges that he himself is a killer, in part due to his catering choices, which might lead innocent children to long-term health complications and shortened lifespans. If we apply that logic from “Worldwide Steppers” to this line from “Watch the Party Die,” it would seem that Kendrick is being a hypocrite for justifying his desire to kill the people whom he despises while not acknowledging that he also deserves to be killed.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, on “Die for the Party,” Lecrae looks at the man in the mirror, sees that he himself is a killer and a hypocrite, which leads him to acknowledge that he deserves death along with all the other hypocrites.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>killers</strong> sittin&rsquo; in they cell for <strong>takin&rsquo; somebody innocent</strong><br>
And they don&rsquo;t even feel no remorse, <strong>the worst ignorance</strong><br>
<strong>But when I take a look in the mirror</strong><br>
The <strong>blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer</strong><br>
Who had Bathsheba in his quarters<br>
I&rsquo;m that- who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I&rsquo;m that sinner<br>
<strong>I deserve death along with all these liars and hypocrites</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Burning the whole village with men, women, and children would normally be seen as an act of injustice and inhumane brutality. However, if everyone is a killer, Kendrick seems to have no issue with any collateral damage that he would cause while trying to exterminate the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party.”<br>
 </li>
<li>The justification for burning the whole village naturally follows from the idea that we are all killers and the idea that we should kill the killers who like taking innocent lives.<br>
 </li>
<li>By saying “it’s really that time,” Kendrick connects the idea of burning the whole village to the opening line, “I think it’s time to watch the party die.”</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament</summary>
    
      <h4 id="burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">&ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it&rsquo;s really that time&rdquo; &gt; Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>From a biblical perspective, the idea of a whole village being burned does bring to mind the Old Testament story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where two towns of rapists were destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies, as I mentioned in the <a href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">&ldquo;Wicked sexual misbehavior in the Bible&rdquo;</a> section.<br>
 </li>
<li>The motif of fire coming down from the sky gets further developed in the stories about the Prophet Elijah, who served as a prophet to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had its capital in a city called Samaria.<br>
 </li>
<li>Around 50 years earlier, the Northern Kingdom of Israel, with its capital in Samaria, had split from the Southern Kingdom of Judah, with its capital in Jerusalem, after a rebellion and a near civil war.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>This split would be the beginning of an animosity between Samaria and Judah that would continue to escalate for centuries.<br>
 </li>
<li>In English, the name Judah was later shortened to the word &ldquo;Jew,&rdquo; which is the word that is now used to refer to the ethnic group that is originally from this geographic area and the religion that was originally practiced by this ethnic group.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the time, Israel had almost entirely turned away from worshiping God and was instead worshiping a fertility and sex god named Ba’al. As part of the worship of this fertility god, the Israelites presumably would have been going to the god Ba’al’s temple to participate in feasts and have ritualized sex with temple prostitutes.<br>
 </li>
<li>The worship of Ba’al was introduced to the Kingdom of Israel by a king named Ahab, who “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” King Ahab married a princess named Jezebel from one of the neighboring nations, which God had specifically forbidden the Israelites from entering into marriage relationships with because those nations worshiped false gods like the fertility god Ba’al.<br>
 </li>
<li>According to a prophecy from Elijah, God stopped the sky from raining any water to prove that worshiping the fertility and sex god Ba’al would actually diminish the land’s agricultural fertility and, as a consequence, also diminish the sexual fertility among the Israelites. This prophecy angered King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, who then unsuccessfully tried to murder Elijah.<br>
 </li>
<li>At some point after Ahab’s son succeeded Ahab as king, God sent Elijah to confront the king about the ongoing worship of Ba’al. The king sent a military captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah. However, Elijah called down fire from the skies, which came down and burned the captain and all the soldiers to death. The king then sent another captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah, but they too were burned to death when Elijah called down fire from the skies. Finally, a last captain of fifty soldiers came and humbled himself before Elijah, who this time did not call down fire on the soldiers. (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%201%3A1-15&amp;version=NASB">2 Kings 1:1-15</a>)</li>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament</summary>
    
      <h4 id="burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--refusing-fire-from-heaven-in-the-new-testament">&ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it&rsquo;s really that time&rdquo; &gt; Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--refusing-fire-from-heaven-in-the-new-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given the motif of fire raining down from the skies to destroy the wicked in the Old Testament, it is notable that one particular New Testament story in St. Luke&rsquo;s account of the Gospel (aka &ldquo;Good News&rdquo;) seems to intentionally undermine the desire one might have for God to send fire to destroy one&rsquo;s enemies. (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209%3A52-56&amp;version=NASB">Luke 9:52-56</a>)<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that story, Jesus and his disciples go to a village in Samaria, the same city where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had long ago led the Israelites to worship the fertility and sex god Ba’al.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the time of Jesus, the people of Samaria did worship Yahweh, the God of Israel, but the Samaritans and the Judeans considered each other to be enemies because:<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>The Judeans considered the Samaritans to be “heretics” who did not worship Yahweh in the way that Yahweh was supposed to be worshiped.<br>
 </li>
<li>About 550 years earlier, the Samaritans had tried to prevent the Judeans from building a temple in Jerusalem.<br>
 </li>
<li>About 140 years earlier, there was a military campaign in which the Judeans from Jerusalem destroyed the Samaritan’s temple to Yahweh, killed lots of people, and destroyed their capital city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Jesus entered the Samaritan village, Jesus&rsquo;s followers announced him as the rightful king of the Judeans, who was on his way to Jerusalem to be crowned and enthroned as king. However, due to the longstanding hatred between Judeans and Samaritans, the Samaritans did not accept Jesus and expressed visible hostility to Jesus’s arrival.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two of Jesus’s disciples, St. James and St. John, seemed to have been greatly displeased by the cold reception that the Samaritans were giving to Jesus. Likely influenced by their own hatred of the Samaritans, Jesus’s two disciples asked Jesus:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus immediately became angry with those two disciples and strongly criticized them by saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“You do not know what kind of spirit you belong to. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy human lives, but to [save / rescue / heal] them.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: The term “Son of Man” is how Jesus typically referred to himself in the Gospel accounts (See the Bible Project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6cWEcqxhlI">Son of Man video</a>).<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By expressing his desire to “burn the whole village,” Kendrick seems to be exhibiting the same misguided way of thought as the disciples who wanted to destroy their enemies in the name of serving Jesus. In doing so, James, John, and Kendrick totally disregarded Jesus’s desire to have his enemies apologize, repent, and allow Jesus to save, rescue, and heal their lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Within the context of current events in 2024, one can also see the Israeli military action against Hamas and the resulting damage or destruction of two thirds of buildings in Gaza an example of the Israeli government deciding that it is justifable to “burn the whole village” in order to kill the killers who executed the October 7, 2023 attack.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “see the future first” could be a reference to Frank Ocean’s track, “Nikes.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>We&rsquo;ll let you guys prophesy</strong><br>
<strong>We gon&rsquo; see the future first</strong><br>
Living so the last night feels like a past life<br>
Speakin&rsquo; of the, don&rsquo;t know what got into people<br>
<strong>Devil be possessin homies</strong><br>
<strong>Demons try to body jump</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of “Nikes,” the people who “see the future first” seem to be the ones who truly have a prophetic vision. These true prophets stand in contrast to those who talk as if they can prophesy but are not actually able to see the future in advance.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has repeatedly identified himself as a prophet, most prominently on the final track of <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> and on several tracks that were released in subsequent years.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you&rsquo;re very welcome<br>
You tell me my song is more than a song, it&rsquo;s surely a blessing<br>
But <strong>a prophet ain&rsquo;t a prophet &rsquo;til they ask you this question</strong><br>
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?</em><br>
-&ldquo;Mortal Man&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>The reason my power&rsquo;s here on earth<br>
Salute the truth, when <strong>the prophet say</strong><br>
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA</em><br>
-&ldquo;DNA.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m not a trending topic, <strong>I&rsquo;m a prophet</strong><br>
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel</em><br>
-&ldquo;family ties&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the third verse of “Watch the Party Die,” Kendrick also seems to compare himself and the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry to the biblical prophet Elijah and the wicked Queen Jezebel, who tried to imprison and kill all the true prophets of God who spoke truth while giving prominent positions to false prophets who told lies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s cynical to say I know these <strong>artists</strong> petrified<br>
The end result, in <strong>jail by Jezebel</strong> or <strong>drugged up full of lies</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, we could interpret the current line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to reason with rappers and members of the entertainment industry who profit from telling lies.</p>

<ul>
<li>The word “clown” is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who acts foolishly in a way that attracts a lot of attention.<br>
 </li>
<li>The word “circus” can also be used as a pejorative to describe an environment that is overcrowded, noisy, and chaotic. This pejorative meaning of the word “circus” could potentially be used to describe the “party,” particularly since a party and a circus are both forms of communal entertainment.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, we could interpret this line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to argue with the rappers and members of the entertainment industry who are working for the circus.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Walking someone down&rdquo; is a slang term that refers to premeditated murder, particularly in a shooting where the shooter calmly executes his target.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In “euphoria,” Kendrick confronts Drake while rapping:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Have you ever <strong>walked your enemy down</strong> like with a poker face?</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to <strong>be</strong> inciting his supporters to kill the killers who like taking innocent lives. Kendrick justifies such murders by saying it will “do everyone a solid,” which is a colloquial way of saying that killing such people will do everyone a favor.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the earlier line where Kendrick said <a href="#we-even-kill-the-killers-cause-they-like-taking-innocent-lives--current-events">“We even kill the killers &lsquo;cause they like taking innocent lives”</a>, it seems appropriate to point out that a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die,” this logic was used by significant numbers of people to justify Luigi Mangione’s decision to kill the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. For example, in one <a href="https://youtu.be/KVsu-FHFds8?si=wNtKpbip_tFJOtl3">popular video</a>, the host defends the shooter’s actions and fittingly refers to the shooter as &ldquo;Run &rsquo;em down Jake&rdquo; prior to the shooter&rsquo;s name being discovered and publicized.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tough love</summary>
    
      <h4 id="its-love-but-tough-love-sometimes-gotta-result-in-violence--tough-love">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence&rdquo; &gt; Tough love<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-love-but-tough-love-sometimes-gotta-result-in-violence--tough-love">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term &ldquo;tough love&rdquo; is stereotypically used by parents (particularly dads) to refer to painful discipline that is meant to benefit a child in the long run.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick specifically mentions “tough love” to describe the parenting Kendrick received from his father on the <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em> track “Father Time.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, &ldquo;<strong>Fuck a foul</strong>&rdquo;<br>
I&rsquo;m teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won&rsquo;t think out loud
&hellip;<br>
Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don&rsquo;t take those well<br>
Momma said, &ldquo;That boy is exhausted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<strong>Go fuck yourself<br>
If he give up now, that&rsquo;s gon&rsquo; cost him, life&rsquo;s a bitch</strong><br>
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,&rdquo; I got up quick<br>
I&rsquo;m chargin&rsquo; baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance<br>
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent<br>
Oh, this the part, <strong>he breaks my humility just for practice</strong><br>
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Early mornin&rsquo; wake-ups</strong> (Ah), <strong>practicin&rsquo; on day-offs</strong> (Ah)<br>
<strong>Tough love</strong> (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)<br>
&hellip;<br>
I got daddy issues, that&rsquo;s on me<br>
Lookin&rsquo; for, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, <strong>rarely empathizin&rsquo; for my relief</strong><br>
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee<br>
&lsquo;Cause if I cried about it, he&rsquo;d surely <strong>tell me not to be weak</strong><br>
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself<br>
<strong>Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that “Father Time” is one of the few tracks where Kendrick mentioned Drake by name prior to the feud.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Daddy issues kept me competitive</strong>, that&rsquo;s a fact, nigga<br>
I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what&rsquo;s the narrative, I am that nigga<br>
<strong>When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused</strong><br>
Guess I&rsquo;m not mature as I think, got some healin&rsquo; to do</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that on &ldquo;Father Time&rdquo; Kendrick highlighted how “tough love” can instill unhealthy patterns of thought and lead to immature competitiveness, it is ironic and inconsistent for Kendrick to justify the use of violence against his enemies by claiming it is a result of “tough love.&quot;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also hinted at the idea of tough love leading to violence on “euphoria” when he alluded to rapper YNW Melly. YNW Melly, whose legal last name is ironically &ldquo;Demons,&rdquo; released a hit single called &ldquo;Murder on My Mind” in June 2018, just a few months before a shooting in which he was later accused of murdering two of his close friends, rappers YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>three GOATs left</strong>, and I seen <strong>two of them kissin&rsquo; and huggin&rsquo; on stage</strong><br>
I love &rsquo;em to death and in eight bars, I&rsquo;ll explain that phrase, huh<br>
&hellip;<br>
I pray they my real friends, if not, <strong>I&rsquo;m YNW Melly</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick now seems to be targeting rappers, social media influencers, and other members of the entertainment industry who glorify greed, instant gratification, and conspicuous, unhealthy consumption, particularly when such individuals never actually offer truth to innocent youth whose lives may be shortened if they imitate the examples that are given to them by the entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has discussed the theme of unhealthy consumption throughout his career.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The track “Vanity Slaves” from the <em>Kendrick Lamar EP</em> explores the ways in which Black people in America have become enslaved to White-owned businesses and corporations that lead Black people into financial mismanagement and ruin. From this perspective, Kendrick could make a compelling case that parading gluttony leads to generational racial injustice that dehumanizes Black people much like slavery.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I care about my pride too much</strong><br>
<strong>If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush</strong><br>
If my hair is cut, <strong>if my diamonds is crushed</strong><br>
I look in the mirror, I&rsquo;m trendy enough? Wrong<br>
<strong>Insecurity roams the black community<br>
Homes where kids must have jewelry</strong><br>
The high school female need earrings and details<br>
<strong>So she can be cool</strong> to be amongst popularity<br>
The various <strong>name brands</strong> that reached the price scan<br>
It&rsquo;s not about the right price but more like the right scam<br>
<strong>To rule us all, confuse us all</strong><br>
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw<br>
Now let&rsquo;s draw<br>
The picture of <strong>a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for</strong><br>
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house<br>
That lives around his neck like a white collar<br>
So why fast forward? Then I&rsquo;ll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to <strong>slavery times</strong><br>
Pickin&rsquo; cotton from a field that a white man own<br>
The blacker you are farther you from the white man&rsquo;s home<br>
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity<br>
Before your vanity, they parted our families<br>
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed<br>
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules<br>
And <strong>trapped our minds in a cage</strong>, our freedom was so vague<br>
&hellip;<br>
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot<br>
Called us niggers and figured that we&rsquo;d never live in <strong>pursuit<br>
Of happiness</strong>, we capture these feelings in things that we do<br>
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to<br>
About a perspective, <strong>my shoe selection gotta be Louie<br>
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci</strong>, it&rsquo;s fake then she fool me<br>
She still bad though and her fake Gucci ain&rsquo;t that bad though<br>
We fillin&rsquo; up the gas for <strong>Rollies</strong><br>
Upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin&rsquo; <strong>Kobes</strong><br>
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya<br>
He overcompensate for the life of his ancestors<br>
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw<br>
The reason why the next four-hundred <strong>we gotta floss<br>
Slaves</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I said the four-hundred years we never had nothin&rsquo;<br>
Barely had clothes on our back<br>
Is the reason why <strong>when we get a little bit of change<br>
We over exaggerate on our livin&rsquo; expenses</strong><br>
So <strong>if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house</strong><br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
If you&rsquo;re a female and you <strong>got four, five, six rings on your finger</strong><br>
<strong>Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin&rsquo;</strong><br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
<strong>If you got an &lsquo;02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it<br>
And on the back of the window it says, &ldquo;Get on my level, ho&rdquo;<br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
We all vanity slaves</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track “Alright,” followed by “For Sale? (Interlude)” on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, parading gluttony to tempt young Black people is a satanic plot that is utilized by Lucy (aka Lucifer / the satan / the devil / the false accuser / the adversary / the diabolical one).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?<br>
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?<br>
Anything, see my name is Lucy</strong>, I&rsquo;m your dog<br>
Motherfucker, <strong>you can live at the mall</strong><br>
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it&rsquo;s illegal<br>
I don&rsquo;t think about it, I deposit every other zero<br>
Thinkin&rsquo; of my partner, <strong>put the candy paintin&rsquo; on the Regal</strong><br>

-&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;
 <br>
<em><strong>My name is Lucy, Kendrick</strong>, you introduced me, Kendrick<br>
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick<br>
<strong>Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories<br>

<strong>Lucy gon&rsquo; fill your pockets<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; move your mama out of Compton<br>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br>

It&rsquo;s not so easy, I&rsquo;m at these functions accordingly</em><br>
-&ldquo;For Sale (Interlude)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “LUST.,” Kendrick raps from the perspective of a man and a woman who are being controlled by demonic forces and driven toward an endless routine of conspicuous, unhealthy consumption. Within the logic of “LUST.,” demonic forces seem to be at work under the surface in ways that we normally don’t notice, and thus don’t realize how Black people are being enslaved in a way that is arguably too wicked to apologize for.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Wake up in the mornin&rsquo;, thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout money</strong>, kick your feet up<br>
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then <strong>roll some weed up</strong><br>
<strong>Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don&rsquo;t go to work today<br>
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks</strong> and make it work today<br>
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama<br>
<strong>Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window</strong><br>
Bet your favorite team, <strong>play you some Madden<br>
Go to the club</strong> or your mama house<br>
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
 <br>
Wake up in the morning, thinking &lsquo;bout money, kick your feet up<br>
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up<br>
<strong>Touch on yourself</strong>, call up your nigga, tell him he ain&rsquo;t shit<br>
Credit card scam, <strong>get you a Visa</strong>, make it pay your rent<br>
<strong>Hop on the &lsquo;Gram, flex on the bitches</strong> that be hatin&rsquo; on you<br>
<strong>Pop you a pill</strong>, call up your bitches, have &rsquo;em waitin&rsquo; on you<br>
<strong>Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s whatever, just make it count</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of “LUST.,” Kendrick references a New Testament Bible passage that speaks directly to the dangers of being controlled by gluttony and lust.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lately, in <strong>James 4:4</strong> says<br>
&ldquo;<strong>Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord</strong>&rdquo;<br>
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>James 4:4 refers to a section of teaching that St. James, the stepbrother of Jesus, gave to Christians who were getting into conflicts because of their lust, gluttony, and desire for all the material possessions that can be obtained in this world. St. James warns these Christians that living in this way leads to pride (i.e., exalting themselves above others to get what they want). Moreover, St. James warns that those who become proud become enemies of God, who opposes those who are proud and gives grace to those who are humble.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Where do wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your body parts? You lust, and do not have. You murder and want what someone else has, and can’t obtain it. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires</strong>.
 <br>
You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that <strong>friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</strong> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “<strong>God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble</strong>.
 <br>
Therefore submit yourself to God. <strong>Resist the devil</strong>, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you inconsistent people. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. <strong>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>By saying, &ldquo;The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose,&rdquo; Kendrick is asserting that those who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo; are guaranteed to be executed alongside the killers who &ldquo;like taking innocent lives.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>Since their deaths are all but certain, Kendrick cold-heartedly recommends that these people should make plans for their own funeral. Since these people have been so consumed by their own vanity for commercialized products, Kendrick seems to suggest that they should take the time to pick the casket that will allow them to take their vanity to the grave.</li>

<p>Getting “chipped” is a slang term for getting killed, particularly by gunshots that are fired to put an end to a conflict, as can be heard in several of Kendrick&rsquo;s past tracks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here, Kendrick seems to be criticizing social media influencers who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth.&rdquo; These influencers are often followed by thousands or even millions of impressionable young people. Once they amass a significant number of followers, these particular influencers profit from convincing young people that they need to buy sponsored products, which may then lead young people to steal money through credit card scams.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is worth noting that in the years prior to the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; several social science research studies published papers that found <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.870614/full">connections between materialistic social media content and problematic consumption behavior among young people</a>.<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang usage, the word &ldquo;basic&rdquo; is a pejorative that describes something that is mainstream, popular, and trending, or someone who is unrefined and boring because they only like things that are mainstream, popular, and trending.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Kendrick, &ldquo;basic shit&rdquo; from the mainstream entertainment industry seems to be the exact opposite of the thoughtful, complex, and creative artistry that has defined Kendrick&rsquo;s career—most notably with Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>DAMN.</em> winning a <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kendrick-lamar">Pulitzer Prize</a>.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Poetic Justice&rdquo; (featuring Drake) from <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick highlights how finding someone who is not &ldquo;basic&rdquo; is as rare as finding a flower that bloomed in a dark room.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I recognize your fragrance</strong>, hol&rsquo; up, you ain&rsquo;t never gotta say shit, uh<br>

<p>While the term “dickriding” is most often used metaphorically to describe someone who says an excessive amount of good things to gain favor, the most literal usage of the term refers to a man or woman who willingly receives anal or vaginal sexual penetration from a powerful man in order to receive favorable treatment or economic opportunities.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&amp;t=6033">viral Club Shay Shay interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)</a>, Katt Williams highlighted how from the start of his career in the entertainment industry, his entire goal was to become successful without ever literally or metaphorically riding anyone’s dick.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked a penis</strong>. That was my only goal.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve had to turn down $50 million four times</strong> - four times - just <strong>to protect my integrity and that virgin hole</strong> I was telling you about, right. Cause <strong>P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong> You&rsquo;ve got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I did.</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast to men who &ldquo;dickride&rdquo; and are &ldquo;with the basic shit,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be highlighting the kinds of rare character traits and behaviors that he wants his people to nurture, particularly self-improvement, education, hard work, financial stability, and a desire or thirst for things that will lead to life.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are traits and behaviors that are often best developed during childhood and adolescence and thus would be at risk if rappers, influencers, or members of the entertainment industry are allowed to “parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More specifically, Kendrick is looking for the rare men who have the mentality of soldiers who lost everything in battle but found a way to learn invaluable life lessons from those losses.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick could be looking to recruit these soldiers to be his executioners.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts” from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick mentioned that the ability to learn from a loss is something that he did not receive from how his own father parented him, but it is a blessing that Kendrick wants his loved ones to receive.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Daddy issues made me lеarn losses</strong>, I don&rsquo;t take those well</em><br>

I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive<br>
<strong>I bless it that you can learn from a loss</strong>, I bless it that you heal<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Thirst is a concept that Kendrick mentioned on the latter half of the pivotal track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city.</em> On that track, Kendrick described how a life of gluttony led him and others to be overcome by a deep spiritual thirst.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>How many sins</strong>, oh? I&rsquo;m runnin&rsquo; out, oh<br>
How many sins, oh? I lost count<br>
Dreams of ballin&rsquo; like Spalding<br>
But only shotty bounce, oh<br>

<strong>You dyin&rsquo; of thirst, you dyin&rsquo; of thirst<br>
So hop in that water, and pray that it works</strong></em>.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the track “LUST.” from <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick seems to allude to the experience of &ldquo;dying of thirst&rdquo; as he reveals the demonic influence that is driving people toward greed, conspicuous consumption, and the need for &ldquo;holy water.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I need some water</strong><br>
Something came over me<br>
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a skit at the end of &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst,&rdquo; an older Christian woman sees that Kendrick and his friends were &ldquo;dying of thirst&rdquo; because their sadness and anger were driving them toward killing their enemies and putting their own lives at risk. She tells them that their thirst for blood and violence was really a spiritual thirst that could only be satisfied by “holy water,” being baptized by the Spirit of the Lord, and receiving a new kind of life from Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?<br>
I know that&rsquo;s not what I think that is<br>
Why are you so angry?<br>
See, <strong>you young men are dying of thirst</strong><br>
Do you know what that means?<br>
<strong>That means you need water, holy water<br>
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord<br>
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?</strong><br>
Okay, repeat after me:<br>
&ldquo;Lord God, I come to You a sinner&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And I humbly repent for my sins&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe that Jesus is Lord&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe You raised Him from the dead&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I would ask that Jesus come into my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And be my Lord and Savior&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I receive Jesus to take control of my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>And that I may live for Him from this day forward</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus<br>
For saving me with Your precious blood&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name, amen&rdquo;<br>
Alright now, remember this day<br>
<strong>The start of a new life, your REAL life</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The older Christian woman&rsquo;s conclusion that Kendrick and his friends are dying of thirst and need holy water seems to come from a scene in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel. In that scene, Jesus stops to rest in a village inhabited by people from an ethnic group called the Samaritans, who were enemies of the Judean ethnic group to which Jesus belonged. Instead of calling down fire from heaven to burn up the Samaritan village, Jesus starts a conversation with a Samaritan woman who is drawing water from a well. Jesus tells the woman that he could give her &ldquo;living water,&rdquo; which would satisfy her so completely that she would never thirst again.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.<br>
 <br>
So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Judean, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans).<br>
 <br>
Jesus replied to her, “<strong>If you knew the gift of God</strong>, and who it is who is saying to you, &lsquo;Give Me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and <strong>He would have given you living water</strong>.”<br>
 <br>
She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” Jesus answered and said to her, “<strong>Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.</strong>”</em><br>
 <br>
-John 4:5,7-14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, as Jesus repeats his offer of &ldquo;living water&rdquo; to a crowd of people at a holiday feast, St. John explains that the &ldquo;living water&rdquo; which Jesus speaks about is actually the &ldquo;Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Jesus would give the &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; to his disciples so that his disciples would be filled with new patterns of thoughts and emotions that would empower them to live a new kind of life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “<strong>If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink</strong>. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, &lsquo;From his innermost being will <strong>flow rivers of living water</strong>.&rsquo;”<br>
 <br>
This He said in <strong>reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive.</strong></em><br>
 <br>
-John 7:37-39<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells the sister of his dead friend that “I am the resurrection and the life.” Jesus then goes on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&amp;version=NASB">John 11:1-45</a>).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that same Gospel account, Jesus also tells his disciples, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life” (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&amp;version=NASB">John 14:2-6</a>).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When applied to this line on “Watch the Party Die,” the belief that Jesus is &ldquo;the life&rdquo; and the giver of &ldquo;living water&rdquo; implies that a “thirst for life” is truly a “thirst for Jesus.” Moreover, those who &ldquo;thirst for life&rdquo; discover that Jesus can satisfy their deepest thirst when they read the stories about Jesus in the &ldquo;Good Book,&rdquo; aka the Holy Bible.</p>

<li>Kendrick seems to highlight the virtue of individuals who know that they will earn a reward when they do the right thing, which motivates them to read books and seek information to help them find out what is right.

<li>Kendrick seems to be asserting that the vast majority of men currently have not developed the kind of virtuous traits or behaviors that he described in the previous lines.

<ul>
<li>In contrast to rappers who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth,&rdquo; Kendrick expresses his sadness at the loss of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved South Central rapper who was murdered in March of 2019. Nipsey&rsquo;s murder was particularly tragic because Nipsey had shown a remarkable commitment, vision, ingenuity, entrepreneurship, business acumen, and diplomacy in his efforts to improve his local community.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nipsey started a community co-working space named <a href="https://www.thesportspublicist.com/agency/vector-90-x-nispey-hussle">Vector 90</a>, which provided opportunities for Black youth in Crenshaw to take science, technology, engineering, and math courses and develop as entrepreneurs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nipsey was closely involved in the planning and advisory stages of an open-air museum called Destination Crenshaw, which was designed to showcase the history and culture of Black people in his neighborhood.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nipsey arranged meetings with the Los Angeles Police Department to discuss ways to stop gang violence.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Nipsey&rsquo;s death, former President Barack Obama wrote a tribute that said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it – to build a skills training center and a coworking space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow – is a legacy worthy of celebration. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it.</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the verses of “Watch the Party Die,” which seem to be persuasive rhetoric addressed to those who will support Kendrick&rsquo;s campaign of vigilante executions, the chorus seems to be a prayer that is addressed to God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of praying to God is a recurring motif in Kendrick&rsquo;s work, going all the way back to the track &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; on Kendrick&rsquo;s first project under the name Kendrick Lamar, the 2009 <em>Kendrick Lamar EP</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I found myself losing focus <strong>at a Sunday service</strong><br>
Embarrassed so <strong>I start questioning God, &ldquo;What is my purpose?&rdquo;</strong><br>
<strong>He said to live the way he did</strong>, that&rsquo;s all he want from me<br>
<strong>Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday</strong><br>
I said alright, <strong>enthused that my Lord gave a listen</strong><br>
<strong>I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian</strong><br>
And this from a person that never believed in religion<br>
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man, I can&rsquo;t help but give in</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2012, Kendrick used his major label debut album, <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, to tell the backstory of how he first became a Christian. The album&rsquo;s first track, &ldquo;Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; begins with Kendrick and his homies saying a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinner%27s_prayer">&ldquo;Sinner’s Prayer&rdquo;</a> to receive Jesus as their &ldquo;personal savior.&rdquo; This prayer is later heard within the narrative context during the pivotal moment in &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst&rdquo; when an older Christian woman approaches Kendrick and his homies and implores them to start a new way of life after Kendrick&rsquo;s friend Dave was killed in a gang shootout.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?<br>
I know that&rsquo;s not what I think that is<br>
Why are you so angry?<br>
See, you young men are dying of thirst<br>

That means you need water, holy water<br>
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord<br>
<strong>Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?</strong><br>
Okay, <strong>repeat after me</strong>:<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Lord God, I come to You a sinner&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And I humbly repent for my sins&rdquo;</strong><br>
&ldquo;I believe that Jesus is Lord&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe You raised Him from the dead&rdquo;<br>
<strong>&ldquo;I would ask that Jesus come into my life&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And be my Lord and Savior&rdquo;</strong><br>
&ldquo;I receive Jesus to take control of my life&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And that I may live for Him from this day forward&rdquo;</em>*<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood&rdquo;<br>

<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s second major label album, <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of Lucy (aka Lucifer / the devil / the satan / the false accuser / the diabolical one). Lucy acknowledges that she heard Kendrick saying the &ldquo;Sinner&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; to God the Father on <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, but is nonetheless confident that Kendrick would abandon God and pursue Lucy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You said <strong>Sherane ain&rsquo;t got nothing on Lucy</strong><br>

Kendrick, Lucy don&rsquo;t slack a minute, Lucy work harder<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; call you even when Lucy know <strong>you love your Father</strong><br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album</strong>, truly<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s third major label album, <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) repeatedly expressed feelings of sadness and frustration because he felt that nobody was praying for him. Then, during the album&rsquo;s pivotal track, &ldquo;FEAR.,&rdquo; Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail explaining that Kendrick&rsquo;s feelings of sadness and frustration were not due to a lack of people praying for him but were instead due to Kendrick&rsquo;s own lack of faithfulness in following the Lord&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>

<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s fourth major label album, <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick seemed to depict himself as being—at least temporarily—distant from God and detached from his identity as a Christian while exploring alternative spiritual practices, including praying to flowers and trees.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, <strong>I prayed to the flowers and trees</strong><br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s first battle track, &ldquo;euphoria,&rdquo; Kendrick implied that Drake was an absentee father while rapping about his own role as a father, including the responsibility of teaching one&rsquo;s son to pray.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y&rsquo;all think all my life is rap?<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s second battle record, &ldquo;6:16 in LA,&rdquo; Kendrick spoke directly to God while seemingly confessing that he was engaging in the battle with Drake in part because his identity was wrapped up in being a soldier who needs to go to war in order to have a stable identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom<br>
<strong>God</strong>, ah, my confession is yours<br>
But, <strong>who am I if I don&rsquo;t go to war?</strong></em></li>

      <h4 id="god-give-me-life-dear-god-please-give-me-peace--the-lords-prayer">&ldquo;God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace&rdquo; &gt; The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#god-give-me-life-dear-god-please-give-me-peace--the-lords-prayer">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea of a person praying for God to give them what they truly need is one of the central points of the most famous and universal Christian prayer, which is known as the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&rdquo; Those who pray the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer ask for God the Father to give them their &ldquo;daily bread&rdquo; in reference to the essential physical and spiritual needs on a daily basis in order to live.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Our Father</strong>, who is in heaven,<br>
hallowed be Your name.<br>
Your Kingdom come.<br>
Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
<strong>Give us today our daily bread</strong>,<br>
and forgive us our tresspasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us,<br>
and lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from the evil one.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;bread&rdquo; being symbolic of the things that someone needs to live is further explored in a story where Jesus multiplies five loaves of bread in order to feed five thousand men and their families (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A13-21&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 14:13-21</a> or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A1-15&amp;version=NASB">John 6:1-15</a>).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, after a crowd of those who ate the multiplied bread began to focus exclusively on their desire for Jesus to fulfill their physical hunger for earthly bread, Jesus told the crowd that he himself is the spiritual &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; and that anyone who eats Jesus as the &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; will live forever.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus said to them, “<strong>I am the bread of life</strong>; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. For <strong>this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life</strong>, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day. <strong>I am the bread of life</strong>. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that <strong>anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh</strong>. Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life</strong>, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, <strong>the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.</strong></em><br>
-Matthew 6:35,40,48-58</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, just before Jesus was arrested and executed on a cross, he shared a meal of bread and wine with his disciples and told them that the bread was his body and the wine was his blood. This particular meal of Jesus&rsquo;s disciples eating bread as Jesus&rsquo;s body and drinking wine as Jesus&rsquo;s blood became the most central Christian spiritual practice, known as the &ldquo;Communion,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Eucharist,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>*<strong>Jesus took some bread</strong>, and after a blessing, He broke it and **gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.”*<em>And when He had taken <strong>a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the [covenant / agreement]</strong>, which is being poured out <strong>for many for forgiveness of sins</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, if we see Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer during the chorus of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; as an echo of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, we could conclude that what Kendrick truly needs to receive is Jesus himself and the new way of life that comes from living in close communion with Jesus. This is the same conclusion that was presented to Kendrick when the older Christian woman convinced Kendrick and his homies not to kill their enemies and instead led them to say the &ldquo;Sinner&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&rdquo;<strong>I would ask that Jesus come into my life</strong>&quot;<br>
&ldquo;And <strong>be my Lord</strong> and Savior&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I receive Jesus to take control of my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And <strong>that I may live for Him</strong> from this day forward&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus for <strong>saving me with Your precious blood</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name, amen&rdquo;<br>
Alright now, remember this day<br>
<strong>The start of a new life, your REAL life</strong></em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to referring to himself as the &ldquo;bread of life,&rdquo; Jesus also describes himself as &ldquo;the life&rdquo; on a few other occasions in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel.</p>
<ul>
<li>After one of Jesus&rsquo;s friends died, Jesus told the sister of the friend, “I am the resurrection and the life.” Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&amp;version=NASB">John 11:1-45</a>).<br>
 </li>
<li>In that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life” (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&amp;version=NASB">John 14:2-6</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus repeatedly teaches that he came to earth not to kill or destroy humans but to give &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; to all those who would listen to his teaching and believe in him.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Son of Man be lifted up, so that <strong>everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him</strong>. For <strong>God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life</strong>. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.</em><br>
-John 3:14-17<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life</strong>; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life.</em><br>
-John 3:36<br>
 <br>
<em>Jesus answered and said to the Samaritan woman, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but <strong>the water that I will give him will become</strong> in him <strong>a fountain of water springing up to eternal life</strong>.”</em><br>
-John 4:13-14<br>
 <br>
The one who reaps is receiving wages and is <strong>gathering fruit for eternal life</strong>.*<br>
-John 4:36<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life</strong>, and does not come into judgment, but has <strong>passed out of death into life</strong>.</em><br>
-John 5:24<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life</strong>; and <strong>it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me</strong>; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.</em><br>
-John 5:39-40<br>
 <br>
*Do not work for the food that perishes, but *<em>work for the <strong>food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you</strong>.</em><br>
-John 6:27<br>
 <br>
<em>For <strong>this is the will of My Father</strong>, that <strong>everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life</strong>, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.</em><br>
-John 6:40<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.</strong> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that <strong>anyone may eat from it and not die</strong>. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; <strong>if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever</strong>; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.</em><br>
-John 6:47-51<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. <strong>The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life</strong>, and I will raise him up on the last day.</em><br>
-John 6:53-54<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish</strong>; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.</em><br>
-John 10:27-28<br>
 <br>
<em>The one who loves his life loses it, and <strong>the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life</strong>.</em><br>
-John 12:25<br>
 <br>
<em>The Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. And <strong>I know that His commandment is eternal life</strong></em>.<br>
-John 12:49-50</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of these teachings about &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; lead up to a culminating prayer in which Jesus talks directly to God the Father and declares that &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; is the experience of knowing God the Father and Jesus as the Son of God in a close relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Jesus spoke</strong> these things; and <strong>raising His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father</strong>, the hour has come; glorify <strong>Your Son</strong>, so that the Son may glorify You, just as You gave Him authority over all humanity, so that to all whom You have given Him, He <strong>may give eternal life. this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ</strong> whom You have sent.</em><br>
-John 17:1-3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, when Kendrick prays, &ldquo;God, give me life,&rdquo; Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is life. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about love and forgiveness so that Kendrick can judge and execute the very same people whom Jesus came to offer eternal life.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Just before he was arrested and executed, Jesus gave one final teaching to his disciples. In that final teaching, Jesus said that he was giving &ldquo;peace&rdquo; to his disciples. Moreover, Jesus clarified that he himself is the peace that he was giving to his disciples. The disciples would receive this peace by listening to Jesus&rsquo; words and remaining in a close relationship with him.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you</strong>; not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. These things I have spoken to you so that <strong>in Me you may have peace</strong>. In the world you have oppression, but be of good courage for I have overcome the world.</em><br>
-John 14:27, 16:33</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, in Jesus&rsquo;s most famous collection of teachings, he declared that his disciples would be blessed with a close relationship with God the Father when they serve as peacemakers in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessed are the peacemakers</strong>, for they <strong>will be called children of God</strong>.
-Matthew 5:9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, when Kendrick prays, &ldquo;Dear God, please give me peace,&rdquo; Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is peace. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about being a peacemaker so that Kendrick can try to overcome the evils of the world through violence.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, the word &ldquo;lame&rdquo; refers to anything that is not cool, refined, or worthy of honor.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer to keep &ldquo;these lame niggas away&rdquo; seems to echo the end of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, which asks God the Father to lead his people away from tempting situations and away from the &ldquo;evil one,&rdquo; in reference to the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;].</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Lead us not into temptation</strong>, but <strong>deliver us from the evil one.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By praying to &ldquo;keep these lame niggas away from me,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be asserting that these &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; are members of &ldquo;the other side,&rdquo; which is opposed to &ldquo;God&rsquo;s side.&rdquo; If Kendrick were to follow the example of Jesus and the early Christians, he would be praying to transform these &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; so that they could repent, apologize, and come to &ldquo;God&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In hip-hop terminology, “shining” refers to wearing gaudy amounts of expensive, shiny diamond jewelry or otherwise making public displays of one&rsquo;s success, wealth, and power.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Kendrick earlier expressed his desire to kill rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth,” it is likely that Kendrick is not asking God to give him shiny jewelry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the previous requests for life and peace, it seems more likely that Kendrick is making a request for spiritual well-being rather than material or financial well-being.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical terminology, “shining” refers to the way in which people who follow God&rsquo;s commandments serve as a bright example of how other humans should live.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the introduction to St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, St. John introduces Jesus by saying that Jesus is the &ldquo;true light&rdquo; who has existed even before the universe was created. Moreover, St. John asserts that through Jesus&rsquo;s birth as a human, the &ldquo;light&rdquo; has now come down from the skies to &ldquo;shine&rdquo; on humans and penetrate through the darkness of human wickedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and <strong>the life was the light of humanity. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn&rsquo;t overcome it…the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a crowd of listeners that he is the &ldquo;light of the world,&rdquo; and that humans can follow him so that they may find the light of life and no longer walk in the darkness of death.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “<strong>I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life</strong>.”</em><br>
-John 8:12</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to identifying himself as the &ldquo;light of the world,&rdquo; in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus also taught his disciples that they are the &ldquo;light of the world,&rdquo; meant to &ldquo;shine&rdquo; the light of his way of life so that people in the world do not have to walk toward the darkness of death.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You all are the light of the world</strong>. A city located on a hill can&rsquo;t be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bucket, but on a lampstand; so it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, <strong>let your light shine before humans, so that they may see your good actions and glorify your Father who is in heaven</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 6:14-16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By teaching that humans who are faithful to God will shine spiritual light to indicate how other humans should live, Jesus seems to be referring to an Old Testament prophecy from the Prophet Daniel.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Many of those who sleep (i.e. are dead) in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt. <strong>Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the sky. Those who turn many toward right relationship will shine as the stars forever and ever.</strong></em><br>
-Daniel 12:2-3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by praying, &ldquo;Dear God, keep me shinin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is light. This request is ironic because, throughout the verses, Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about being a &ldquo;light to the world&rdquo; by being an example to those who are living in darkness and giving them an opportunity to turn toward right relationships with other humans. Rather than turning wicked people toward the light of life, Kendrick continues to express his desire to bring the darkness of death upon the hosts and attendees of the party.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer to God seems to be interrupted as he wonders what the “lame niggas&quot; are thinking about him. Kendrick seems to conclude that the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; are thinking that he is acting like a police officer who is &ldquo;pocket-watching&rdquo; them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Pocket-watching&rdquo; refers to the act of closely monitoring what another person is doing—particularly regarding their use of money—so that the monitoring person can make some kind of judgment or assessment of the other person.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within hip-hop culture, rappers, hustlers, and &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; often describe an adversarial relationship with the police, most famously on the legendary rap group NWA&rsquo;s hit single &ldquo;Fuck tha Police.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying that Kendrick &ldquo;must be the police,&rdquo; the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; seem to be expressing some amount of nervousness that they might be caught, prosecuted, and judged for any illicit actions that they might have committed at &ldquo;the party.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that Kendrick “must be the police” would also align with the battle track “meet the grahams,” where Kendrick claimed to be &ldquo;policing&rdquo; the &ldquo;weird shit&rdquo; going on in the entertainment industry after he dropped the bombshell allegation that Drake and his OVO crew have allegedly been sex trafficking underaged girls.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra, sit down, what I&rsquo;m about to say is heavy, now listen<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After wondering what the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; are** thinking about him, Kendrick goes back to praying to God. He now asks God to &ldquo;bless&rdquo; the words that he is rapping and the words that he is thinking.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical terminology, a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; refers to God giving preferential favor to people, places, objects, or things so that they may bring about more life and goodness on the earth.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the very first narrative of the Bible, God gave a blessing to animals and then humans so that they would reproduce new life to fill the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>God created</strong> the great sea creatures and <strong>every living creature</strong> that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. <strong>God blessed them</strong>, saying, “<strong>Be fruitful and multiply</strong>, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”<br>
 <br>
<strong>God created humanity</strong> in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. <strong>God blessed them</strong>; and God said to them, “<strong>Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth</strong>, and subdue it; and <strong>rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth</strong>.”</em>
-Genesis 1:21-23,27-28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when humans are tempted by the devil in the form of a snake and disobey God&rsquo;s commandment by trying to define good and evil for themselves, their actions result in *a curse that leads to death and evil on the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then the LORD <strong>God said to the snake</strong>,<br>
 <br>
“Because you have done this,<br>
<strong>Cursed are you</strong> more than all the livestock,<br>
And more than any animal of the field;<br>
On your belly you shall go,<br>
And <strong>you shall eat dust<br>
All the days of your life</strong>;<br>
 <br>
Then the LORD <strong>God said to the human</strong>, “<strong>Because you</strong> have listened to the voice of your wife, and <strong>have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, &lsquo;You shall not eat from it&rsquo;</strong>:<br>
 <br>
<strong>Cursed is the ground because of you</strong>;<br>
With hard labor you shall eat from it<br>
All the days of your life.<br>
<strong>It will grow both thorns and thistles</strong> for you;<br>
Yet you shall eat the plants of the field;<br>
By the sweat of your face<br>
You shall eat bread,<br>
<strong>Until you return to the ground</strong>,<br>
Because from it you were taken;<br>
For you are dust,<br>
And <strong>to dust you shall return</strong>.”</em>
-Genesis 3:14,17-19</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of humanity receiving a blessing or a curse depending on whether they obey or disobey God&rsquo;s commandments is a recurring biblical motif that gets further developed in the Book of Deuteronomy when the Prophet Moses gives a speech to the Israelites before they go into the &ldquo;Promised Land&rdquo; which God had prepared for them. Moses repeatedly told the Israelites that God was offering them a choice between life and death, between a blessing and a curse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you diligently obey the Lord your God</strong>, being careful to <strong>do all His commandments</strong> which I am commanding you today, that the Lord your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And <strong>all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God</strong>:
 <br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will you be in the city, and <strong>blessed</strong> will you be in the country.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will be your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will you be when you come in, and <strong>blessed</strong> will you be when you go out.<br>
 <br>
But it shall come about, <strong>if you do not obey the Lord your God, to be careful to follow all His commandments</strong> and His rules which I am commanding you today, that all <strong>these curses will come upon you</strong> and overtake you.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will you be in the city, and <strong>cursed</strong> will you be in the country.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will be your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, the newborn of your herd, and the offspring of your flock.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will you be when you come in, and <strong>cursed</strong> will you be when you go out.<br>
 <br>
The LORD shall smite you with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.<br>
 <br>
I have <strong>placed before you today life and good and also death and evil</strong>. For I command you today to <strong>love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments</strong>, his rules, and his justice, <strong>that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you</strong>. I have <strong>placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse</strong>. Therefore <strong>choose life, that you may live, you and your seed</strong>, to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; <strong>for he is your life</strong>, and the length of your days.<br>
 <br>
-Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19,28 30:15-16,19-20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the New Testament, Jesus and his chosen disciples commanded followers of Jesus love and bless their enemies and not to hate and curse them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus taught them saying, “You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo; But I say to you, <strong>love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven</strong>; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</em><br>
-Matthew 5:43-45
 <br>
<em><strong>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse</strong></em>.<br>
-St. Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Romans 12:14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that throughout the verses of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick has used his words to call for the execution of the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and has been ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s commandments to love his enemies and bless those who have persecuted him, it is ironic that Kendrick is now praying for God to &ldquo;bless his words&rdquo; and &ldquo;bless how he think.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that the title for Kendrick&rsquo;s album, <em>DAMN.</em>, is a shortening of the word &ldquo;damnation,&rdquo; which is a synonym for &ldquo;curse&rdquo; and the opposite of a &ldquo;blessing.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;BLOOD.,&rdquo; the first track on <em>DAMN.</em>, opens with a voice that presents a choice between life and death, similar to the choice that the Prophet Moses placed in front of the Israelites.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it wickedness?<br>
Is it weakness?<br>
<strong>You decide.<br>
Are we gonna live or die</strong>?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;YAH.,&rdquo; the third track on <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick identifies himself as an Israelite and refers to a conversation in which his cousin Carl Duckworth told him that he was &ldquo;cursed&rdquo; based on Moses&rsquo;s speech from Deuteronomy about blessings and curses.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a Israelite</strong>, don&rsquo;t call me black no mo&rsquo;<br>
That word is only a color, it ain&rsquo;t facts no mo&rsquo;<br>
My cousin called, <strong>my cousin Carl Duckworth<br>
Said</strong> know my worth<br>
And <strong>Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;FEAR.,&rdquo; the pivotal track on <em>DAMN.</em>, we hear a voicemail in which Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin Carl Duckworth quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and asserts that Kendrick is experiencing a cursed existence because he has not been following God&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What&rsquo;s up, family?<br>
Yeah, it&rsquo;s <strong>your cousin Carl, man, just givin&rsquo; you a call</strong>, man<br>
I know you been havin&rsquo; a lot on yo&rsquo; mind lately<br>
And I know you feel like, you know<br>
People ain&rsquo;t been prayin&rsquo; for you<br>
But you have to understand this, man, that <strong>we are a cursed people</strong><br>
<strong>Deuteronomy 28:28 says,<br>
&ldquo;The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart&rdquo;</strong><br>
See, family, <strong>that&rsquo;s why you feel like you feel</strong><br>
Like you got a chip on your shoulder<br>
<strong>Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way&hellip;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Verse 2 says,<br>
&ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,<br>
therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities&rdquo;<br>
So <strong>until we come back to these commandments<br>
Until you come back to these commandments<br>
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse</strong><br>
Because He said He&rsquo;s gonna punish us<br>
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians<br>
Are the true children of Israel<br>
<strong>We are the Israelites, according to the Bible</strong><br>
The children of Israel<br>
<strong>He&rsquo;s gonna punish us</strong> for our iniquities, <strong>for our disobedience</strong><br>
Because we chose to follow other gods<br>
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee<br>
So, just like you chasten your own son, He&rsquo;s gonna chasten you<br>
<strong>Because He loves you</strong>, so that&rsquo;s why we get chastised<br>
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in the position that we&rsquo;re in<br>
<strong>Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments<br>
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us</strong><br>
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live<br>
Here, in today, in the United States of America<br>
I love you, family, and I pray for you<br>
God bless you<br>
Shalom</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be asking God to make a distinction between himself and the “lame niggas&quot; whom Kendrick wants God to keep away from him.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be requesting something similar to what God did when he rescued the Israelites from slavery.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to being rescued, the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptian Pharaoh, who forced the Israelites to live in slave houses in a region near the capital of Egypt. When Pharaoh worried that the Israelite population was becoming too large, he sent orders for soldiers to kill every baby boy born to an Israelite mother.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God saved one Israelite boy named Moses and later called Moses to be a prophet. God then sent Moses to confront Pharaoh by telling him to let the Israelites go free. When Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God used Moses to send ten different plagues, which brought death and destruction upon Egypt.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the first nine plagues, God said that he was going to send a final tenth plague in which a spirit of death would pass through the capital of Egypt and the neighboring regions. This spirit of death would kill the firstborn sons and male animals of every household as a punishment for Pharaoh and the Egyptians for killing the Israelites&rsquo; newborn sons.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since this plague of death was going to pass through the region of the Israelite slave houses, God told the Israelites that their sons and male animals would be spared if each Israelite household celebrated a Passover (aka Pesach / Pascha) ritual meal. During the Passover meal, each Israelite family would kill a lamb, smear the blood on the posts and crossbar of their exterior door, and eat the lamb meat with unleavened bread. When the spirit of death came across a door covered in lamb&rsquo;s blood, it would “pass over” the house without killing the firstborn son or male animals.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God told Moses that by bringing death to the firstborn sons of Egypt while providing a way to preserve the lives of the sons of Israel, God was creating a line of separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. But against any of the children of Israel a dog won&rsquo;t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, *<em>that you may know that the LORD makes a line of separation</em> between the Egyptians and Israel.<br>
-Exodus 11:6-7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by praying, &ldquo;Dear God, draw the line&rdquo; and prevent anyone from confusing Kendrick with the &ldquo;lame niggas,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be asking God to kill the “lame niggas,&quot; similar to how God sent the spirit of death to kill the sons of the Egyptians who took the innocent lives of the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the New Testament, there are several instances where Jesus speaks of a future day when he will separate the righteous from the wicked.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about a landowner who instructs his servants to plant wheat seeds in a field. However, after the servants plant the wheat seeds, a deceptive adversary—who represents the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;]—comes at night to plant seeds that will grow into weeds that look like wheat but do not produce any grain (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A24-30%2C36-43&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 13:24-30,36-43</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>When the wheat and the weeds begin to sprout up, the servants discover that someone has planted weeds among the wheat. The servants initially want to pull out all the weeds from the field. However, the landowner stops them.<br>
 </li>
<li>The landowner tells the servants that because the wheat and the weeds look very similar at this stage of their development, if the servants try to pull up the weeds, they may accidentally pull up some of the wheat as well. Moreover, since the wheat and the weeds are planted so close together, even if they can accurately distinguish between them, pulling up the weeds may uproot the wheat.<br>
 </li>
<li>The landowner tells the servants that it is not yet time to pull up the weeds. Instead, the landowner tells the servants to wait until the time of the harvest when all of the wheat has had the chance to be fruitful and produce grain. At that point, the servants will be able to accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds. The servants will then gather the wheat together and burn up the weeds to dispose of them.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus explains that this parable is a metaphor for the &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; at the end of the world as we know it, when those who have lived lives in right relationships will be gathered together in God&rsquo;s new creation, while the wicked are excluded from God&rsquo;s new creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be a kind of disobedient servant who refuses to listen to the landowner&rsquo;s instructions and is convinced that now is the time to pull out the weeds. If he continues to disobey the landowner&rsquo;s instructions, Kendrick may end up destroying the lives of those who will eventually produce good grain.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is particularly ironic that in the first verse, Kendrick described himself as &ldquo;the man that resides in patience,&rdquo; but by saying, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to watch the party die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be too impatient to wait for the time that the Lord has set to bring an end to wickedness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells another parable about the &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; in which the Lord will be like a herder who takes a mixed herd of sheep and goats into the pastures. However, at the end of the day, the herder separates the sheep from the goats and places the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus explains that the sheep represent people who have maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need. In contrast, the goats represent people who have not maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the parable, many of the people who turn out to be sheep are not aware that they did anything in their lives that would cause them to be included among the sheep. Similarly, many of the people who turn out to be goats are not aware that they failed to do things that would have allowed them to be included among the sheep.<br>
 </li>
<li>The fact that the identity of the sheep and the goats is a surprise that is not revealed until the end of time suggests that all humans should not be quick to assume that someone else is a goat or assume that they themselves are sheep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be convinced that he is one of the sheep. However, by advocating for burning down entire villages and ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s commandments to love his neighbor, Kendrick is acting more like a goat who has failed to maintain right relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Forgiveness in the New Testament</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-the-new-testament">&ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin&rsquo; how hard I tried&rdquo; &gt; Forgiveness in the New Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-the-new-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s final request is for God to grant him forgiveness. In case God might not be inclined to forgive him, Kendrick tries to justify himself by pointing out how hard he has tried to do what&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The request for God&rsquo;s forgiveness echoes the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, which includes the following request:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Forgive us</strong> our transgressions (i.e. violations of trust)<br>
<strong>as we forgive</strong> those who transgress against us (i.e. violate our trust)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After teaching his disciples the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Jesus specifically highlighted the request for forgiveness by making it clear that God would not forgive those who refuse to forgive others.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>If you forgive</strong> humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], <strong>your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive</strong> humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], <strong>your Father will also not forgive your [transgressions / violations of trust]</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 6:14-15</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later on in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, one of Jesus&rsquo;s disciples asked how many times he should forgive a brother who has done something wrong to him. In response, Jesus told his disciples a parable that reflected on the necessity for God&rsquo;s people to forgive other humans because God has already forgiven his people to a much greater degree (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A21-35&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 18:21-35</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>In this parable, there is a king—representing God the Father—who has many servants—representing different humans, particularly followers of Jesus.<br>
 </li>
<li>One of these servants has somehow borrowed large amounts of money from the king and now owes the king what in today&rsquo;s currency would be equivalent to $8 billion.<br>
 </li>
<li>When the king realizes how much money the servant owes him, the king announces plans to sell the servant into slavery along with the servant&rsquo;s wife and children in order to at least recoup some money.<br>
 </li>
<li>The servant then falls on the ground and begs the king not to sell him into slavery. He even tells the king that he will repay the equivalent of $8 billion that he owes.<br>
 </li>
<li>The king has compassion on the servant, releases him from his impending slavery, and forgives all of the servant&rsquo;s debts.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, immediately after having his debts forgiven, the first servant walks out of the king&rsquo;s court and sees a second servant who owes the first servant what would be the equivalent of $14,000.<br>
 </li>
<li>The first servant immediately grabs the second servant by the neck, begins choking him, and demands that the second servant pay him back.<br>
 </li>
<li>The second servant then falls on the ground and begs the first servant to be patient, and he will repay the equivalent of $14,000 that he owes.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, the first servant refuses to forgive the second servant. Instead, the first servant throws the second servant into a debtor&rsquo;s prison, where the second servant will be forced to work for three or more months in order to pay the first servant back.<br>
 </li>
<li>Soon, the king finds out what the first servant did to the second servant and calls the first servant back to his court. The king becomes angry with the first servant and strongly condemns him for refusing to forgive a $14,000 debt after the king had forgiven him a much, much larger $8 billion debt.<br>
 </li>
<li>The king then once again holds the first servant responsible for the $8 billion debt. The king orders the first servant to be thrown into debtor&rsquo;s prison until he has repaid the entire debt. This punishment is essentially a life sentence because it would take 164,000 years of labor for the first servant to pay the king back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on Jesus&rsquo;s teaching on the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the parable of the unforgiving servant, it is deeply ironic that Kendrick is praying, &ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me,&rdquo; after he has refused to forgive Drake or anyone who has participated in &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and has even claimed, &ldquo;this shit done got too wicked to apologize.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, based on Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, Kendrick&rsquo;s self-justification that God knows &ldquo;how hard I tried&rdquo; seems destined to fall on deaf ears and be rejected by God. Jesus discussed how he would reject the pleas of individuals who claimed to do lots of things for God but refused to actually do what God the Father commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus taught his disciple saying, &ldquo;<strong>Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Fathe</strong>r who is in heaven will enter. <strong>Many will say to Me</strong> on that day,<br>
 <br>
&lsquo;Lord, Lord, <strong>did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?</strong>&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
And then <strong>I will declare to them, &lsquo;I never knew you; leave Me, you who act against the law.</strong>&rsquo;&rdquo;</em><br>
 <br>
-Matthew 7:21-23</li>

<li>
<p>The need for forgiveness has been a central theme within both <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;DNA.&rdquo;, the second track of <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick rapped about the fact that his rough upbringing taught him so many things he needed to know to become successful in the world, but the one thing that he wished he had received was to be nurtured in a way that would allow him to forgive others.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I know murder, conviction<br>
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption<br>
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and<br>
<strong>I wish I was fed forgiveness</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier&rsquo;s DNA</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme of monetary debts in the parable of the unforgiving servant also reminds us of the track &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; from <em>DAMN.</em>, where Kendrick tells a story about his friend&rsquo;s son who was killed because of &ldquo;insufficient funds.&rdquo; When the friend called Kendrick and asked for spiritual guidance from an anointed Christian, Kendrick ignored Jesus&rsquo;s teachings by saying that he would never forgive someone who harmed any one of his family members and that the friend should not forgive either.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101<br>
Said <strong>they killed his only son because of insufficient funds</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
He said, &ldquo;K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me<br>
<strong>I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome</strong>&rdquo;<br>
He was lookin&rsquo; for some closure, <strong>hopin&rsquo; I could bring him closer<br>
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him</strong><br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel<br>
<strong>If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin&rsquo; killed</strong><br>
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of<br>
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch<br>
I wait in front a nigga&rsquo;s spot and watch him hit his block<br>
I catch a nigga leavin&rsquo; service if that&rsquo;s all I got<br>
<strong>I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong><br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman<br>
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother<br>
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first verse of &ldquo;Mother I Sober&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick acknowledged his battles with sex addiction, infidelity, and violations of trust in his relationships with Whitney, his fiancée, and the mother of his children. As he reckoned with the pain that he had caused to an innocent soul, Kendrick asked God whether he could be forgiven for what he had done.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Intoxicated, <strong>there&rsquo;s a lustful nature</strong> that I failed to mention<br>
Insecurities that I project, <strong>sleepin&rsquo; with other women</strong><br>
<strong>Whitney&rsquo;s hurt, the purest soul I know</strong>, I found her in the kitchen<br>
<strong>Askin&rsquo; God</strong>, &ldquo;Where did I lose myself? And <strong>can it be forgiven?</strong>&rdquo;<br>
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, <strong>&ldquo;Is there an addiction?&rdquo;</strong><br>
I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but this time <strong>I lied</strong>, I knew that I can&rsquo;t fix it<br>
<strong>Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me</strong><br>
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme of forgiveness has noticeably been absent from the diss tracks that Kendrick released during his battle with Drake. Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die,&rdquo; Kendrick seems to fully reject the idea of forgiving anyone even as he prays for God to forgive him.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Forgiveness and punishment</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-and-punishment">&ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin&rsquo; how hard I tried&rdquo; &gt; Forgiveness and punishment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-and-punishment">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I do think it is important to point out that within the context of the Bible, forgiveness does not mean that society, law enforcement, or victims should allow a crime to go unpunished or—even worse—allow a perpetrator to continue harming the victim or other future victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This point is actually illustrated quite clearly by the Old Testament story of King David using his power to traffic a woman to his palace, force her to have sex with him, and then kill her husband to cover up a pregnancy. In that case, God sent a prophet to directly confront David about his evil and unjust actions. David admitted to being guilty under God&rsquo;s judgment, repented, was forgiven by God, and was spared from the death penalty. However, David&rsquo;s actions had real-world consequences that led to the deaths of at least three of David&rsquo;s sons as well as a significant amount of societal shame. Over time, this shame made countless men in David&rsquo;s time—along with later readers of the Bible—think twice about allowing uncontrolled sexual desire to lead them to coercing women or murdering people to cover up earlier acts of wickedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One can also look at the New Testament story from St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, in which a woman was caught while she was having sex in an adulterous relationship. Unlike the case of the woman with King David, she had apparently chosen to engage in this sexual relationship. She was then brought before an all-male court of Judean religious leaders who appealed to Jesus to serve as a trial judge to sentence her to death under the rules laid out in the laws given to Moses (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A1-11&amp;version=NASB">John 8:1-11</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus sent all the accusers away by pointing out that they themselves had done things against the law of Moses that the Israelites were supposed to follow and thus should not feel that it was their right to condemn the woman to the death penalty.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus had not done any actions that broke the law of Moses, so he theoretically had the right to condemn the woman to the death penalty. However, he chose not to. Instead, Jesus told the woman, &ldquo;I do not condemn you. Go on your way. From now on, do not sin anymore.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>In this case, Jesus let the woman go free without any additional punishment beyond the societal shame that she had already experienced and would likely continue to experience. Jesus did not completely remove this consequence, though he did mitigate it to some degree by pointing out the lawless actions of her accusers.<br>
 </li>
<li>Moreover, Jesus warned her by saying, “Do not sin anymore.” This statement echoes a previous statement from Jesus after he healed a man and told him, “Now you have become well. Do not sin anymore, or something worse will happen to you.”<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, Jesus&rsquo;s ultimate goal was for the woman not to be immediately killed for her wickedness but for her to find healing and be transformed so that she would be able to stop herself from acting in a way that would ruin her relationships and result in a negative final judgment at the end of time.</li>

<ul>
<li>After praying to God throughout most of the chorus, Kendrick ends the chorus by doubling down on the first line of the first verse. Kendrick further emphasizes his desire to execute the hosts and attendees of the party by saying &ldquo;watch the party die&rdquo; three times and adding the phrases &ldquo;send &rsquo;em home&rdquo; and &ldquo;get &rsquo;em gone,&rdquo; which are both slang phrases for killing someone.</li>

<ul>
<li>Kendrick begins the second verse with the same line from beginning of the first verse. Additionally, the chorus ended with Kendrick saying &ldquo;watch the party die&rdquo; three times. By continuing to repeat this phrase, Kendrick seems to be speaking like someone with an unhealthy obsession with vigilante justice.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be highlighting more people who should be executed for the benefit of society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Street niggas&quot; refer to young Black men who are engaged in selling drugs, hustling, robberies, gang banging or any other kind of illegal activity that is done to get money. These kinds of activities are statistically more common in densely populated, urbanized neighborhoods in major American cities where people are more likely to walk through the city on street sidewalks in contrast to American suburbs where many people exclusively drive from one place to another.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The illegal activities in which &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; often engage often lead to violence, murder and other casualties as Kendrick has detailed throughout much of his work, such as the track “Poe Man&rsquo;s Dreams” from <em>Section.80</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>My mama is stressin&rsquo;, my daddy tired<br>
<strong>I need me a weapon</strong>, these niggas ride<br>
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me<br>
How I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; listen when I don&rsquo;t even hear God?<br>
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts<br>
My hands dirty, you worried &lsquo;bout mud in your sink<br>
You like to mistake a <strong>street nigga</strong> for real nigga<br>
The <strong>same nigga that kill with you&rsquo;ll squeal with you</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since “street niggas&quot; typically depict themselves as people who like to kill others, they would likely be included among the peaople who Kendrick planned to execute when he said &ldquo;We even kill the killers &lsquo;cause they like taking innocent lives.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate guys&rdquo; likely refers to the entertainment industry&rsquo;s corporate employees who are paid to find ways of making money from music, films and other forms of entertainment. In many cases, their approach to making money is not in the best interest of the artist who makes the work, the audience who consumes the work, or the society in which the work is distibuted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case that &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; are trying to make money from the stories of &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo;, the resulting work may actually lead the audience to immitate behavior that leads some individuals to kill other individuals.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within both <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick has pointed out that corporate employees often hide their tendency to be killers and murderers while teaching their own deceptive philosophies to the youth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>It&rsquo;s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
Homicidal thoughts</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;XXX.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run<br>
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage,<br>
<em>the market is crashin&rsquo;, the industry wants<br>
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box<br>
while they makin&rsquo; a mockery followin&rsquo; us</em></em><br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t Monopoly</strong>, watchin&rsquo; for love.<br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t monogamy. Y&rsquo;all gettin&rsquo; fucked</strong>*<br>
-&ldquo;N95&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
*<strong>I&rsquo;m a killer, he&rsquo;s a killer, she&rsquo;s a killer</strong>, bitch<br>
<strong>We some killers</strong>, walkin&rsquo; zombies, tryna scratch that itch<br>
&hellip;<br>
<em>Eight billion people on Earth, <strong>silent murderers</strong><br>
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)<br>
<strong>Hollywood corporate in school, teachin&rsquo; philosophies</strong><br>
You either gon&rsquo; be dead or in jail, <strong>killer psychology</strong><br>
<strong>Silent murderer, what&rsquo;s your body count? Who your sponsorship?</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate guys&rdquo; may thus be complicit with those who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo; and for whom &ldquo;the graveyard is company&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Rather than &ldquo;givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;, &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; often appropriate the stories from &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; and package them in music made by &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;N95.&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick seemed to expose liars in the rap game and demand that they take off their lies like an actor taking off a mask.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You&rsquo;re back outside, but <strong>they still lied</strong><br>

<strong>Take off them fabricated streams</strong> and them microwave memes, it&rsquo;s a real world outside<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s also notable that in the battle tracks, Kendrick repeatedly called Drake a liar, actor, and manipulator who has tried to borrow stories and credibility from &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>famous actor</strong> we once knew is lookin&rsquo; paranoid and now is spiralin&rsquo;<br>

<ul>
<li>In addition to ordering the execution of the &ldquo;street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies&rdquo;, Kendrick says that he &ldquo;needs&rdquo; the families of these individuals to be “mortified”. The word &ldquo;mortified&rdquo; refers to someone feeling ashamed, particularly when they are in the view of the public.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that in early forms of English—from the 1300s to the 1700s—the word “moritiy” meant “to kill”. The word was originally derived from the Latin word “mortificō” which literally meant “to put to death”. In early forms of English, &ldquo;mortify&rdquo; was often used metaphorically to refer to the act of subduing, humbling, or humiliating someone.<br>
 </li>
<li>By using the word mortify, Kendrick subtly brings up the idea that the family of the street niggas, corporate guys, and lying rappers should also be killed. The idea of killing family members of excessively wicked individuals connects back to first verse where Kendrick told his supporters to “burn the whole village”.</li>

<p>Certain hip hop media figures, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXtyIYSPadY&amp;t=596s">DJ Akademics</a>, have explained that arguments, hatred and information that is leveraged within rap battle often spreads because many rappers will often have sex with the same set of women. These women end up pillow-talking about the other rappers with whom they have had sex.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DJ Akademics—who is sometimes referred to as Ak&rsquo;—is also known for being a loyal supporter of Drake. Kendrick previously suggested that DJ Akademics is compromised on “6:16 in LA”.</p>

<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;no more pillow-talkin&rsquo;&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be implying that he will be giving orders to execute the &ldquo;dirty-macking bitches&rdquo; who have attended &ldquo;the party&rdquo; or had sex with the street niggas, corporate guys or rappers that report the lies.</p>

<li>“Macking” refers to physical contact, conversations, or other flirtatious actions that a person does to flirt or attract someone with whom the person wants to have sex.<br>
 </li>
<li>Dirty can be used to describe something that is dishonorable or something that is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.<br>
 </li>
<li>Here Kendrick seems to be criticizing the “dirty ackin&rsquo;” women and men whose &ldquo;pillow-talking&rdquo; is leading to neighborhood wars.<br>
 </li>
<li>Kendrick seems to suggest the reason why men or women get into these &ldquo;dirty-macking&rdquo;, &ldquo;pillow-talking&rdquo; sexual relationships because they are insecure men who need the validation of an attractive woman agreeing to have sex with them or insecure women who need the validation of a famous rapper expressing a strong desire to have sex with them.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, &ldquo;flashy&rdquo; is an adjective which describes someone who shows off or flaunts their wealth and possession. &ldquo;Flashy niggas&rdquo; might thus be included among those who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of “dirty” from the previous line gets escalated to “nasty”, conveys a sense of repulsion or aversion. Both &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; are used as slang adjectives to describe someone who is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; and &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; are both synonyms for the word &ldquo;freaky&rdquo; which Kendrick used when he described Drake as a &ldquo;freaky ass nigga&rdquo; and a &ldquo;69 god&rdquo;—in reference to an adventurous form of simultaneous oral sex-on &ldquo;Not Like Us.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In English &ldquo;having a backbone&rdquo; is an idiom for having the courage, strength, and ability to stand up for oneself.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s criticism of &ldquo;the flashy nigga&rdquo; who is &ldquo;usin&rsquo; money as a backbone&rdquo; may also be applied to Drake. Within the battle, Kendrick accused Drake of acting like a tough &ldquo;street nigga&rdquo; even though he has no backbone and has to pass real street niggas to join his crew an be his &ldquo;backbone&rdquo;. However, as Kendrick pointed out, these &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; who are paid to be Drake&rsquo;s &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; are actually a liability because they are not truly loyal to Drake and are only around for the money.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>famous actor</strong> we once knew is <strong>lookin&rsquo; paranoid</strong> and now is spiralin&rsquo;<br>

<p>Drake&rsquo;s strategy of paying &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; and other tough guys to be part of his crew is well documented online most notably in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hgN3ze96zU">this video by HipHopMadness</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Kendrick give even more specific instructions on how he wants the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; to be executed. In this case, he orders his executioners kill the condemned man by hitting him in the head with some kind of blunt weapon until the man&rsquo;s skull is cracked open.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick orders for the execution to happen while the condemned man is out of his house and before the condemned man ever has a chance to come back home that day. The immediacy of these orders further highlights the idea that &ldquo;it is time&rdquo; to watch the party die.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The specificity of these execution orders resembles &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; from <em>DAMN.</em> where Kendrick talked about how he would kill someone who had killed his son by waiting outside of the building where the killer was located and then gun the killer down at his first opportunity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;d wait in front a nigga&rsquo;s spot and watch him hit his block</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A &ldquo;radio personality&rdquo; is host of an radio program, podcast or other form of audio based content who publicly broadcasts his or her perspective on current events or popular culture.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propaganda is the deliberate dissemination of information, ideas, or messages that are often biased or misleading and are designed to influence public opinion, manipulate emotions, or promote a specific agenda or ideology. Propaganda is typically disseminated by powerful or influential political entity, government, industry or group who wants to influence the public in order to control their actions or hold on to power.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick implies that many of these &ldquo;radio personalities&rdquo; are getting paid to use their platform to disseminate propaganda on behalf of the entertainment industry or on behalf of the systems which mentally enslave Black people.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on his 2016 track, &ldquo;Hype&rdquo;, Drake boasts about creating his own propaganda.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I don&rsquo;t take this shit for granted<br>
<strong>I do my own propaganda</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the battle track &ldquo;6:16 in LA&rdquo;, Kendrick accuses Drake of &ldquo;playin&rsquo; dirty with propaganda&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>But let me tell you some game &lsquo;cause I can see you, my lil&rsquo; homie<br>
<strong>You playin&rsquo; dirty with propaganda</strong>, it blow up on ya<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; was released, Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em> whose opening track &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo; mentions &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and specifically criticies a White comedy podcast host who controvertially joked about Black women being emotionally disregulated and violent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t let no white comedian talk about no Black woman</strong>, that&rsquo;s law<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick asserted that Hollywood&rsquo;s corporate leaders and employees are &ldquo;silent murderers&rdquo; who teach their deadly and deceptive philosophies in schools.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>In English the word &ldquo;casualty&rdquo; is used to refer to someone who has died—or in some cases someone who has been injured—during an act of violence such a war or a criminal attack.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the most narrow legal definition, &ldquo;assault&rdquo; is a crime in which a someone causes reasonable fear that they will cause physical harm to another person or make unwanted physical contact with another person. Meanwhile, &ldquo;battery&rdquo; is a crime in which someone actually causes physical harm or makes unwanted physical contact.<br>
 </li>
<li>The use of the terms &ldquo;assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;battery&rdquo; reminds us that the acts of all of these vigilante executions which Kendrick has ordered are illegal, criminal attacks.<br>
 </li>
<li>Moreover, by saying that he wants the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; to experience extreme physical and mental suffering or &ldquo;agony&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to not be satisfied with simply ridding society of wicked people. He seems to be expressing an unhealthy and sadistic enjoyment of knowing that wicked people will experience extreme suffering.</li>

      <h4 id="i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-the-new-testament">&ldquo;I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people&rdquo; &gt; New Earth in the New Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-the-new-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term “New Earth” originates from, &ldquo;The Revelation&rdquo;, the final book in the New Testament and the Bible in which St. John sees a prophetic, visionary “Revelation” from Jesus.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this prophetic vision, Jesus shows St. John how the oppression, persecution, violence and killings that Christians faced under various Roman Emperors from 64 to 100 AD are part of a much larger pattern of the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”] trying to bring death and destruction to those who follow Jesus as their Lord.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus encourages various church communities to “overcome” not by starting a revolution or killing their oppressors, but by forgiving and loving the humans who are acting like enemies, but are really just under the control of the true enemy—the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus encourages these persecuted church communities to trust that one day Jesus will defeat the true enemy. Moreover, Jesus promised that one day, God will bring an end to the world as it currently exists and bring about a &ldquo;New Heaven&rdquo; which fully overlaps with a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo;. In this overlapping &ldquo;New Heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; where all humans will know God, have a loving relationship with God, and obey God&rsquo;s commandments, which will lead to an eternal life of peace, justice and right relationships.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This transformation from the current Earth to the &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; is described in the second to last chapter of &ldquo;The Revelation&rdquo; where St. John describes the end of his vision by saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw <strong>a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away</strong>, and the sea is no more. I saw <strong>the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God</strong>, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, <strong>God&rsquo;s [tent / residence] is with humans, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; There will be no mourning, no crying, no pain, any more</strong>. The first things have passed away.”<br>
-Revelation 21:1-4</li>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">New Earth in New Age Spirituality</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-new-age-spirituality">&ldquo;I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people&rdquo; &gt; New Earth in New Age Spirituality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-new-age-spirituality">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>More recently, biblical concept of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; has also been encorporated into &ldquo;New Age&rdquo; spirituality.<br>
 </li>
<li>“New Age” spirituality is a somewhat fluid category of spiritual beliefs and practices that arose from the &ldquo;hippie&rdquo; and &ldquo;counterculture&rdquo; movement of the late 1960s. Teachers and practitioners of New Age spirituality blend Eastern spiritual traditions (e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism)\ with some aspects of Western Christianity and a modern, secular humanist ethos.<br>
 </li>
<li>After the initial popularity of New Age spirituality in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of New Age ideas in the late late 1990s and early 2000s due to the populaity of self-help psychology books by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle&rsquo;s is known best for his 1997 book <em>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment</em> and his 2005 book <em>A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&rsquo;s Purpose</em>.<br>
 </li>
<li>In 2008, the legendary Black talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, hosted Eckhart Tolle on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his book <em>A New Earth</em>. Oprah also added <em>A New Earth</em> to Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club and hosted a 10-week live online class series where Eckhart Tolle discussed <em>A New Earth</em> chapter by chapter.<br>
 </li>
<li>Similar fashion to other forms of New Age spirituality, <em>A New Earth</em> takes some ideas from the Bible, such as St. John&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;a New Heaven and a New Earth&rdquo; and subtly redefines it through the perspective of Eastern spiritual beliefs, practices, and terminology.<br>
 </li>
<li>In particular, <em>A New Earth</em> builds on the concepts from Tolle&rsquo;s previous book <em>The Power of Now</em> to focus on the Buddhist/Hindu idea that humans must go through an “ego death” so that their suffering will end and their individual identities (or the illusion of their individual identities) can melt away into a new, unified harmony with the universe. Within Tolle&rsquo;s writing, this ego death is  said to take place through practices such a Buddhist forms of emptying meditation that lead a person to awaken into a greater state of awareness or “consciousness” in moment or in the “now”.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>While the influence of Christianity has already been well documented throughout this analysis, it should also be noted that Eckhart Tolle has clearly had a significant influence on Kendrick&rsquo;s work beginning at least as early as 2021 when Kendrick released a video introducing his new media production company, pgLang. This introductory video contains imagery of meditative practices, a clock in which every hour is labeled as &ldquo;now&rdquo;, a scene were a young woman chooses &ldquo;NOW&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;PAST&rdquo; or &ldquo;FUTURE&rdquo;, and a scene were Kendrick sits across from Eckhart Tolle and listens intently as Tolle gives spiritual/psychologial guidance.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Eckhart Tolle is introduced as Kendrick&rsquo;s psychotherapist and a major contributor to the album.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kodak Black, Oklama<br>
<strong>Eckhart Tolle</strong><br>

Whitney:  <em><strong>You really need some therapy</strong>.</em><br>
Kendrick: <em>Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin&rsquo; about?</em><br>
Whitney:  <em>Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck.</em><br>
Kendrick: <em>Shit, everybody stupid.</em><br>
Whitney:  <em>Yeah, well, <strong>you need to talk to somebody. Reach out to Eckhart.</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Father Time&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eckhart Tolle&rsquo;s voice is heard on several occasions on the second half of <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mr. Duckworth&hellip;</em><br>
-&ldquo;Count Me Out&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let&rsquo;s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you&hellip;</em><br>
-&ldquo;Savior (Interlude)&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>This is how we conceptualize human beings</em><br>
-&ldquo;Auntie Diaries&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>People get taken over by this pain-body, because this energy field that almost has a life of its own—it needs to periodically feed on more unhappiness.</em><br>
-&ldquo;Mr. Morale&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the last verse of &ldquo;Rich Spirit&rdquo;, ends with Kendrick specifically referencing the &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; after making references to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and other New Age concepts earlier in an the track.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Takin&rsquo; my baby to school, then <strong>I pray for her</strong><br>
&lsquo;Cause you bitches ain&rsquo;t never been cool, <strong>writin&rsquo; testament</strong><br>
Paintin&rsquo; pictures, put me in the Louvre, that&rsquo;s a definite<br>
<strong>Universal shift</strong>, I&rsquo;m in a groove<br>

<strong>The aloof Buddha, I&rsquo;m Christ with a shooter<br>

&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m fasting four days out the week</strong>, brother<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>The New Earth</strong> in hot pursuit, <strong>two-hundred lives</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether Kendrick is currently seeing a vision of the traditional Christian understanding of a “New Earth” or the New Age version, the reference to a peaceful &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; is in sharp contrast to the increasingly violent rhetoric that Kendrick is using throughout the verse.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be implying that the end goal of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; justifies the means of violent and inhumane vigilante executions. This &ldquo;ends-justify-the-means&rdquo; logic twists the prophetic vision of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; into dystopian, totalitarian vision of a bloody revolution and political purge.</p>

<ul>
<li>After ordering the executions of social media influencers on the previous verse, Kendrick is now adding the followers of those influencers to the execution list.<br>
 </li>
<li>In particular he calls out the follower who are “poppin mollies”. &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; is slang for the pure, molecular—from which we get the name molly—form of psychoactive drug MDMA. This pure form of MDMA is distinguished from the drug ecstasy in which MDMA is mixed with other substances.<br>
 </li>
<li>MDMA increases heart rate, makes users feel more energetic, induces increased emotional and sensory experience, increases feelings of connection and empathy and overall leads to feelings of euphoria. However, these positive feelings can lead to an emotional crash and increased anxiety after the effects of the drug wears off.<br>
 </li>
<li>MDMA was originally used in the 1970s to assist with psychotherapy for conditions such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, by the 1980s forms of MDMA and eventually molly began to be used as a “party drug” at raves, electronic music concerts and other dance parties. Molly&rsquo;s status as a “party drug” connects to the recurring motif of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; throughout “Watch the Party Die”.<br>
 </li>
<li>Molly has also been referenced in the lyrics of a countless number of songs by &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>It seems that Kendrick now wants to execute the followers who have been using mollie in order to prevent the usage of the drug from spreading to other innocent lives and negatively affective society.</li>

<ul>
<li>The “followers” who are “poppin mollie” seems to be following the influence of people who Kendrick describes as “degenerates”. The word &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; refers morally corrupt people or more generally to people who have lost desirable physical, mental or social characteristics.<br>
 </li>
<li>Labeling a certain group of people with a term like “degenerates” has historicaly been a propaganda strategy for totalitarian rulers to justify eliminating certain cultural influences or killing off certain group of people.
 </li>
<li>Most notably, in the Nazi Party in Germany began to describe modern art with the term &ldquo;Entartete Kunst&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Degenerate Art&rdquo;. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany because such art was deemed &ldquo;an insult to German feeling&rdquo;. The Nazi party also ran a propaganda campaign against &ldquo;Degenerate Music&rdquo; which specifically targeted jazz music due to its &ldquo;Negroid excesses in tempo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jewishly gloomy lyrics.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>Given that Nazi propaganda would have labeled Kendrick&rsquo;s own form of hip hop music as &ldquo;Degenerate Music&rdquo;, it is ironic that Kendrick is not labeling other media influencers as degenerates and executing them alongside &ldquo;the radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick again seems to be highlighting the hope of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; that can be created after all of the wicked hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; are elimiated from society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be implying that the &ldquo;degenerates&rdquo; among the media influencers are spreading cynical criticism of Kendrick&rsquo;s message of hope. This assessement is conistent with the lines from the first verse where Kendrick said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Influencers talk down &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not with the basic shit</strong><br>
But they don&rsquo;t hate me, <strong>they hate the man that I represent</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because these influencers have been talking down at Kendrick and failing to talk positively about the hope that Kendrick and his supporters are trying to spread through Kendrick&rsquo;s music, Kendrick has included these influencers among those who will be viciously executed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s campaign of totalitarian executions seems to be taking place that is a nominal democracy. Elections are still being held and Kendrick could theoretically be voted out of power. However, if anyone tries to oppose him by running an effective opposition campain or even casting a vote for the opposition, Kendrick wants such a person to be beheaded.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This kind of election where voters are not free to cast their vote without suffering retribution for voting against the ruling party is often referred to as a &ldquo;sham election&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Months before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; in March of 2024, the United States and other Western European allies denounced Russia&rsquo;s presidential election as a &ldquo;sham election&rdquo; after Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President of Russia with 88% of vote, which happed to be the highest percentage vote in the history of Russian democracy.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s re-election follows more than a decade in which political opposition leaders have been harrassed, silenced, imprisoned and assasinated. The most recent casualty was Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian prison under suspicious circumstances in February of 2024, just a month before the election.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick specifially highlighted Vladimir Putin as an example of oppresive leadership after he invaded Ukraine in Febrary of 2022 after claiming that Ukraine was governed by a neo-Nazi regime.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vladimir making nightmares<br>
But that&rsquo;s how we all think</strong><br>
The collective conscious<br>
Calamities on repeat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Kendrick did highlight Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s destructive behavior on &ldquo;Savior&rdquo;, Kendrick overall point seemed to be that Vladimir Putin is not unique or even outside of the norm. Instead, Kendrick asserted that Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s behavior simply reveals the way that all of us natrually think. Here on &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick proudly expresses this collective way thought as he seeks to eliminate anyone who does not support his vigilante campaign.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Bring his head</summary>
    
      <h4 id="you-need-to-bring-his-fuckin-head-or-film-that-shit-in-hi-res--bring-his-head">&ldquo;you need to bring his fuckin&rsquo; head or film that shit in hi-res&rdquo; &gt; Bring his head<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#you-need-to-bring-his-fuckin-head-or-film-that-shit-in-hi-res--bring-his-head">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Kendrick again exhibits sadistic tendencies as he demands to see the decapitated head of the person who did not vote for Kendrick. The executioners must either bring the decapitated head to Kendrick to see or they must film the decapitation in a high resolution video format so that Kendrick can see all of the small details when he watches the recording.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is also notable that the Gospel accounts of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke all tell the story about a wicked queen who conspires to have the king order the beheading of a John, the great prophet who baptized Jesus. Moreover, she got the king to bring John&rsquo;s head to her on a dinner platter.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>John the Baptist was Jesus&rsquo;s cousin and was highly respected prophet who called the Israelites to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (i.e. change their way of thinking) and be baptized. John also spoke out against the unjust actions of powerful figures including Herod, the puppet king of a Roman-controlled, Israelite region called Galilee.<br>
 </li>
<li>John the Baptist publicly criticized King Herod, telling him that it was not right or just for him to take his own brother&rsquo;s wife, Herodias, so that he could marry her for himself.<br>
 </li>
<li>The new queen, Herodias, became very angry at St. John the Baptist and got King Herod to arrest John. Still the queen was not satisfied with just arresting St. John. She wanted him to be killed even though the king was very reluctant to do so. Queen Herodias then looked for a way to kill the prophet John, much like Queen Jezebel looked for a way to kill the prophet Elijah.<br>
 </li>
<li>Then when King Herod threw a birthday party for himself, the queen sent her daughter to dance for Herodias and his guests at the party. The queen&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s dancing was apparently so stimulating and pleasurable for King Herod that without thinking he made an oath in front of all his guests that he would give the queen&rsquo;s daughter whatever she wanted.<br>
 </li>
<li>The daughter consulted with her mother, who immediately told her to ask the king to bring her the head of John the Baptist on a dinner platter. The king was sad and upset with himself because he really didn&rsquo;t want to kill John, but because he had made the oath in front of his guests and was too proud to look dishonorable by going back on his word, he agreed. He immediately ordered soldiers to decapitate John the Baptist and bring the head on a platter to the daughter who then presented it to the queen.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that John the Baptist was decapitated due to a party where a younger girl danced in a sensual way to gratify a group of powerful men brings us back to the motif of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and the alleged trafficing of underage girls for sex parties at Drake&rsquo;s mansion.<br>
 </li>
<li>At the same time, by demanding for his executionors to bring him a the head of the man who refused to vote for him, Kendrick, the King of LA, is now playing the role of King Herod and Queen Herodias who unjustly killed the prophet, John the Baptist.</li>

      <h4 id="sometimes-i-wonder-what-lecrae-would-do--lecrae">&ldquo;Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do&rdquo; &gt; Lecrae<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sometimes-i-wonder-what-lecrae-would-do--lecrae">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here for the first time in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to reconsider whether he is doing the right thing by executing the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular Kendrick wonders whether Lecrae, a famous Christian rapper, would pray for the hosts and attendees of the party or &ldquo;fuck these niggas up&rdquo; by violently assaulting them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae happens to be the most famous and successful artist in the history of the Christian hip hop (aka CHH). Christian hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that utilizes similar production, rapping and singing styles as mainstream hip hop. However, unlike mainstream hip hop, Christian hip hip is committed to presenting lyrics that help people understand and identify with Christian values, beliefs, and behavior.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the necessary commitment to Christian values, beliefs and behavior, artists that are accepted as part of Christian hip hop will not make songs that glorify scamming, gluttony, sexual promiscuity or criminal activity. In fact it is very rare for Christian hip hip artists to release music with any words that would be considered explicit: including profanity, sexual terminology or racial slurs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the high moral and behavioral expectations that come with being a Christian hip hop artis, Lecrae had a rough upbriging that was similar to many mainstream hip hop artists.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae never met his father and was raised by a single mother in a low income, urban, Black neighborhood. He was not raised as a Christian but became a very committed Christian later in life. That background has allowed Lecrae to speak to the reality of &ldquo;street life&rdquo; while also being able to clearly articulate Jesus&rsquo;s teaching in language that is accessible to urban, Black audiences.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to Kendrick on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Lecrae has also publicly wrestled with his faith in God, hypocrisy among Christian leaders including himself, depression, personal struggles with addiction, and the weight of serving as a leader in a Black community facing various social issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Last year I was feeling hopeless<br>
I just wanted it to end</strong><br>
People stealing money from me, man<br>
I swear I thought that we was friends<br>
<strong>And I was so depressed, I was such a mess<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t shake it off<br>
Another murder on the television</strong><br>
Man, somebody go turn it off<br>
<strong>I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it<br>
Thought these people had my back boy<br>
Then they tellin&rsquo; me I asked for it<br>
I guess I&rsquo;m just another black boy<br>
And then they killed Tamir Rice</strong><br>
And they just go on with they life<br>
They tellin&rsquo; me shut up talking &lsquo;bout it<br>
Like, I should just talk about Christ<br>
But <strong>the truth is I started to doubt God<br>
I started to question my purpose<br>
I started to act out</strong><br>
I ain&rsquo;t wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile<br>
<strong>Doctors told me that my man died<br>
I almost had a breakdown
So tell depression it can fly away<br>
Tell my doubts that they can die today</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ma catch me a wave, sail away<br>
Can&rsquo;t stop me now</em><br>
-&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Stop Me Now (Destination)&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>I would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such<br>
You know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch<br>
<strong>I was so involved, never thought that I could fall</strong>, y&rsquo;all<br>
Right before the fall of 2015, I was all off<br>
<strong>It involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down</strong><br>
Tweeted &lsquo;bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground<br>
And Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times<br>
This time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized<br>
Doubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame<br>
&ldquo;Shame on you, &lsquo;Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus&rsquo; name&rdquo;<br>
<strong>Cut me deep, I was losing sleep</strong>, &ldquo;God, ain&rsquo;t these Your sheep?&rdquo;<br>
Why they hate me like they do? Maybe grace is really cheap<br>
Maybe this is all a lie, they don&rsquo;t really love me<br>
They just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public<br>
They&rsquo;re like following they God mean turnin&rsquo; on Black people<br>
Is Black evil? <strong>Why do they hate and attack people?</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m vulnerable and cautious, I&rsquo;m reading Baldwin<br>
Ta-Nehisi got me thinking, now I&rsquo;m going all in<br>
<strong>I ain&rsquo;t know if God was real no mo&rsquo;<br>
Every day we gettin&rsquo; killed and I can&rsquo;t deal no mo&rsquo;<br>
I started slipping in the darkness, I&rsquo;m feeling heartless<br>
Christians got me traumatized, I don&rsquo;t know who God is<br>
Drinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree<br>
Maybe I should get divorced</strong>, I don&rsquo;t know why she married me<br>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the purpose? What&rsquo;s the point?<br>
Nothing matters, I&rsquo;m just matter, I&rsquo;m just atoms<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no Eve and ain&rsquo;t no Adam<br>
Where the Xannies? Let me at &rsquo;em<br>
I was floating in confusion until I dropped<br>
Woke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped</strong></em>
-&ldquo;Deconstruction&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given his background and spiritual perspective, Lecrae seems to be the perfect person to provide Kendrick with a perspective on whether Kendrick should rely on prayer or use violence to improve society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Lecrae released a <a href="https://youtu.be/y2ZC1FEk87Q?si=syqzXoAhmBaRGzAv">podcast episode</a> in which he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the podcast episode, Lecrae accepted that rap battles as an established part of hip hop culture. Since Lecrae grew up with hip hop culture, he was  reluctant to criticize rap battles in and of themselves.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae also acknowledged that Kendrick was providing Drake with some feedback that he probably needed to hear.</p>
<p><em>We all need friends like Kendrick who are willing to tell us about ourselves. I never want to have to run into somebody in a rap battle to tell me the truth about myself.</em><br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Lecrae did express his concern that the way that Kendrick and Drake approached the rap battle (and to some extent how most rappers approach rap battles) demonstrates an unhealthy attempt to build their own sense of value and self-worth based on their ability to beat down another person.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Prayer was a major motif within <em>DAMN.</em>. Throughout that album, Kendrick repeatedly lamented that fact that no one was praying for him. However, at a pivotal point of the album,  Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail telling Kendrick that the cursed existence that he was experiencing was not due to a lack of people praying for Kendrick but due to a lack of Kendrick following God&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>New Kung Fu Kenny<br>
<strong>Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Bitch, all my grandmas dead<br>
So <strong>ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me, I&rsquo;m on your head</strong>, ayy</em><br>
-&ldquo;ELEMENT.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Shit I feel like<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo;<br>
&hellip;<br>
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for &rsquo;em<br>
But who the fuck prayin&rsquo; for me?</strong></em>
-&ldquo;FEEL.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Nobody pray for me</strong><br>
It been that day for me</em><br>
-&ldquo;HUMBLE.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>What&rsquo;s up, family? Yeah, it&rsquo;s your cousin Carl, man, just givin&rsquo; you a call, man. I know you been havin&rsquo; a lot on yo&rsquo; mind lately and <strong>I know you feel like, you know people ain&rsquo;t been prayin&rsquo; for you but you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people</strong>. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, &ldquo;The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness, and astonishment of heart.&rdquo; See, family, <strong>that&rsquo;s why you feel like you feel, like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way</strong>&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Verse 2 says, &ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities&rdquo;. So <strong>until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse</strong>, because He said He&rsquo;s gonna punish us. The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel - He&rsquo;s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods. &ldquo;That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee.&rdquo; So, just like you chasten your own son, He&rsquo;s gonna chasten you, because He loves you. So that&rsquo;s why we get chastised. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in the position that we&rsquo;re in. <strong>Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us. We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live, here, in today, in the United States of America</strong>. I love you, family, and I pray for you. God bless you. Shalom.</em><br>
-&ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>DAMN.</em> thus conveys the idea that prayer is insufficient if individual do not change the way that they live and begin to follow God&rsquo;s commandments. This idea about the need to follow God&rsquo;s commandments and help other to follow God&rsquo;s commandments might thus present a third way as opposed to exclusively praying or exclusively “fucking these niggas up.”</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic; font-size: 24px;">I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1</summary>
    
      




<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--dee-1-exposes-the-satanic-music-industry">&ldquo;I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1&rdquo; &gt; Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--dee-1-exposes-the-satanic-music-industry">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dee-1 is another Christian hip hop artist whose career has run in paralle to Lecrae&rsquo;s. Dee-1&rsquo;s first mixtape was released in 2004, the same year that Lecrae released his first album. However, Dee-1 has not come close to acheiving the level success or influence that Lecrae has had throughout his career.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part of this gap in success could be attributed to skill level and artistic choices. However, from Dee-1&rsquo;s perspective a big part of the gap in success is due to the fact that Dee-1 has been uncompromising in his commitment to deliver music with a clear Christian message and a willingness to call out issues in hip hop culture and the music industry that he sees as being misaligned with Jesus&rsquo;s teaching.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a timing and perspective that runs almost parallel to Katt Williams, Dee-1 gave given an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9subKGoAz8">interview</a> in January of 2024 where he discussed how he has been denied opportunities from entertainment industry &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo; because he wouldn&rsquo;t compromize his own integrity. Most notably, Dee-1 talked about haveing to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to powerful men in the entertainment industry who tried to coerce him into performing oral sex or receiving anal sex in order to receive a record deal.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>There&rsquo;s gatekeepers. So <strong>if you&rsquo;re trying to get signed to a major label, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers. If you&rsquo;re trying to get on certain media platforms to get interviewed, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers. If you trying to get on the mainstream radio, urban radio, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers</strong>. Yes. Yes. Yes.<br>
 <br>
I will say one last thing about gatekeepers—<strong>the only true gatekeeper to what&rsquo;s meant for you in this world is God and your level of integrity</strong>. That&rsquo;s the only two gatekeepers, because what&rsquo;s meant for you and what you want that&rsquo;s two different things and a lot of times people end up wanting things that ain&rsquo;t of God. Now <strong>if you want something that ain&rsquo;t of God, you got to go through gatekeepers&hellip;, who really ain&rsquo;t nobody in in the big scheme of things on the totem pole of people with integrity and people with morals values and principles</strong>. These gatekeepers ain&rsquo;t nobody, <strong>but in this perverted sick twisted industry these gatekeepers do hold access to certain levels</strong>, you know.<br>
 <br>
Bro, <strong>I&rsquo;ve had gatekeepers in the music industry who have literally tried to hold a record deal behind their back and let me know like, &ldquo;Look,if you a part of this homosexual act that I&rsquo;m trying to take part in, this door open real quick fory you.&rdquo; I got a song where I&rsquo;ve talked about that before called &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Playground.&rdquo;</strong> This is real dog and the only way that that type of stuff can work on you is if you let them have all the leverage to where you want what&rsquo;s behind that gate that bad. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a real thing.<br>
 <br>
You also got people—<strong>this a different type of gatekeeper—the gatekeepers who will say, &ldquo;Hey you making too much righteous noise right now. If you just tone that righteousness down a little bit then we&rsquo;ll allow you into these doors, but you got to tone that down. You got to becomea little more vanilla, a little more lukewarm, a little more bland and you&rsquo;ll fit in with us. That&rsquo;s the slick gatekeeping. It ain&rsquo;t telling you to all the way, you know, bend over or or open your mouth or something like that. It ain&rsquo;t that, but it&rsquo;s telling you like dim your light.</strong> And what ends up happening is you got so many people that&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not that bad. They not asking me to do nothing super crazy I just got to dim my light.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the scariest kind right there &lsquo;cause a lot of people will be like, &ldquo;Wait I just got to turn it from level 10 to level 5? Man, bet. I could do that. Bro, all right, bet. Now I get accepted. Cool.&rdquo; <strong>Next thing, you know you got a whole industry that&rsquo;s lukewarm—whole industry lukewarm, so that when somebody that&rsquo;s on fire come along they looking at it like, &ldquo;Whoa, you crazy! Hold on. You shining too bright</strong>. Hold on. Hold on. Chill out, man. You doing the most. You messing up, man. Stop man.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned in that interview, back in 2017, Dee-1 released a track called &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo; in which he mentioned having to say no to powerful man in music industry who offered to manage Dee-1 if Dee-1 would have sex with him. Dee-1 highlighted this experience as an example of how the entire music industry is under the control of Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Lucifer laughs when he listens to the radio<br>
Enjoyin&rsquo; all the hate blastin&rsquo; through the stereo<br>
His plan worked, our music gives him glory<br>
Sex, drugs, and murder</strong> now listen to this story&hellip;<br>
 <br>
<strong>Down here with these devils in the playground<br>
Evil forces workin&rsquo; hard I can&rsquo;t play around<br>
I can feel &rsquo;em tryin&rsquo; to drag me down</strong><br>

I&rsquo;m in the trenches here in Babylon<br>
<strong>This world of darkness that I travel on<br>
I know the games that the devil plays<br>
I feel him creepin&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t get away</strong><br>
 <br>
<strong>Devils on devils on devils on devils on devils<br>
They all in this industry</strong><br>
Not everybody real, and<br>
<strong>For the dollar bill friends turn into my enemies</strong><br>
They knew I was broke<br>
So <strong>they asked me to sell my soul<br>
Three Million dollars plus make a blood sacrifice<br>
But I said, &ldquo;Nooooooo&rdquo;!<br>
This man said if I slept with him he&rsquo;ll manage me</strong><br>
Yeah, ya&rsquo;ll know him<br>
<strong>I spit in his face and said, &ldquo;boy don&rsquo;t play with me!&rdquo;</strong><br>
I said, &ldquo;Lord this just too much&rdquo;<br>
So I&rsquo;m just gonna work with church folk<br>
<strong>Then I found out some of these church folk<br>
Be some of the most crooked on Earth folk</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>It&rsquo;s entertainment but it&rsquo;s deeper, though<br>
Behind the scenes there&rsquo;s some things you don&rsquo;t even know<br>
Messin&rsquo; with this game, you could lose your soul<br>
&lsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s an evil creepin&rsquo; deep below</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>You think you the man, don&rsquo;t ya?<br>
But the Devil got his hand on ya<br>
The Devil&rsquo;s just usin&rsquo; you</strong><br>
He makin&rsquo; a fool of you<br>
Yeah, I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to you, you right there<br>
The one with the fame, the one with the money<br>
The one with the platinum plaques, yeah, yeah<br>
You know your name!<br>
<strong>I came in the game with the flame and I aim to be sayin&rsquo;<br>
Everything in the name of the Man who created</strong><br>
The land, the sand, the sun, and the moon<br>
Holds life in the palm of his hand<br>
Do you hear what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;?<br>
Man, I&rsquo;m really tryin&rsquo; to wake you<br>
This ain&rsquo;t no game so I can&rsquo;t be playful<br>
<strong>Sellin&rsquo; these lies, music that&rsquo;s hateful<br>
The devil say you great, but God say you ungrateful</strong> (echo)<br>
So what we gonna do now?<br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t beef it&rsquo;s more deep<br>
I don&rsquo;t fight for me, I fight for the army of G-O-D</strong><br>
But I luv you dawg, my brother for life<br>
Separated at birth, but <strong>I pray you come to the light</strong></em></li>

<p>Dee-1&rsquo;s claim that the music industry is under the control of Lucifer / the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; is a view that Kendrick has also expressed going back to 2015 with the tracks &ldquo;Alright&rdquo; and &ldquo;For Sale? (Interlude)&rdquo; from *To Pimp a Butterfuly&quot;. In those tracks, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of a music industry leader named &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, short for Lucifer, who approach Kendrick and offered Kendrick wealth, success, and material possessions if Kendrick would sell his soul to her.</p>

<strong>I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby<br>
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times<br>
&lsquo;Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified<br>
That I (Want you)</strong><br>
You said <strong>Sherane ain&rsquo;t got nothing on Lucy</strong><br>

You said to me, <strong>you said your name was Lucy</strong><br>
I said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ricardo?&rdquo;<br>
You said, &ldquo;Oh, no, not the show&rdquo;<br>
Then you spit a little rap to me like this<br>
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, &ldquo;Oh, shit&rdquo;<br>
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:<br>

<p>Moreover, a few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em> which centers around the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; where Kendrick retells the biblical narrative pattern of &ldquo;Lucifer&rdquo;. In Kendrick&rsquo;s retelling, Lucifer is a fallen angel who has been reincarnated numerous times in the form of various musicians whose gluttony led them to use their musical skills and influence to deceive the masses and mentally enslave them under Lucifer&rsquo;s control.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I did <strong>past life regression</strong> last year and it fucked me up<br>
<strong>Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus<br>
Body after body</strong>, lesson after lesson, let&rsquo;s take it <strong>back to Michigan in 1947<br>
My father kicked me out the house &lsquo;cause I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to him</strong><br>
I didn&rsquo;t care about his influence, only loved what I was doing<br>
<strong>Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level<br>
The most talented where I&rsquo;m from, but I had to rebel</strong><br>
And so I&rsquo;m off in the sunset, searchin&rsquo; for my place in the world<br>
With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled<br>
<strong>I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect<br>
While the record business loved me<br>
I was head of rhythm and blues<br>
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose<br>
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses<br>
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Another life had placed me as a Black woman</strong> in the Chitlin&rsquo; Circuit<br>
<strong>Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains<br>
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed<br>
A musical genius</strong> what the articles emphasized<br>
<strong>Had everything I wanted, but I couldn&rsquo;t escape addiction<br>
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted</strong><br>
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be<br>
<strong>Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity<br>
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments<br>
I needed drugs</strong>, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin<br>
<strong>Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar<br>
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo;</strong><br>
My first assistant was a small town scholar<br>
Never did a Quaalude &rsquo;til I got myself around her<br>
<strong>My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me<br>
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>My present life is Kendrick Lamar<br>
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe</strong><br>
The only factor I respected was raisin&rsquo; the bar<br>
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh<br>
<strong>My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him<br>
I&rsquo;m old enough to understand the way I was livin&rsquo;<br>
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment</strong><br>
I close my eyes, hoping that I don&rsquo;t come off contentious<br>
I&rsquo;m yelling, &ldquo;Father, did I finally get it right?&rdquo; Everything I did was selfless<br>
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them<br>
I didn&rsquo;t gloat, even told &rsquo;em, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when the vultures came<br>
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed<br>
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed<br>
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself<br>
Father, I&rsquo;m not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down<br>
&ldquo;But <strong>your pride has to die</strong>,&rdquo; okay, Father, show me how<br>
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for<br>
I kept one hundred institutions paid<br>
Okay, tell me more<br>
I put one hundred hoods on one stage<br>
Okay, tell me more<br>
I&rsquo;m tryna push peace in L.A.<br>
But you love war<br>
No, I don&rsquo;t<br>
Oh, yes, you do<br>
Okay, then tell me the truth<br>
<strong>Every individual is only a version of you<br>
How can they forgive when there&rsquo;s no forgiveness in your heart?</strong><br>
I could tell you where I&rsquo;m going<br>
<strong>I could tell you who you are<br>
You fell out of Heaven &lsquo;cause you was anxious<br>
Didn&rsquo;t like authority, only searched to be heinous<br>
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent<br>
My greatest music director was you</strong><br>
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues<br>
It was harmony and motion<br>
<strong>I sent you down to earth &lsquo;cause you was broken<br>
Rehabilitation, not psychosis</strong><br>
But now we here now<br>
<strong>Centuries you manipulated man with music<br>
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving<br>
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views</strong><br>
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval<br>
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear<br>
The more that word is diminished, the more it&rsquo;s not real<br>
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel<br>
I&rsquo;m using words for inspiration as an idea<br>
So can you promise that you won&rsquo;t take your gifts for granted?<br>
I promise that I&rsquo;ll use my gifts to bring understanding<br>
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?<br>
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now<br>
<strong>You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m ashamed that I ever created that enemy<br>
Then let&rsquo;s rejoice where we at<br>
<strong>I rewrote the devil&rsquo;s story just to take our power back, &lsquo;carnated</strong></em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Dee-1 released a podcast episode which discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake. In comparison to Lecrae&rsquo;s podcast, Dee-1 was much more willing to directly criticize Drake, Kendrick and the culture of rap battles as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Dee-1&rsquo;s uncompromising perspective, the entire battle between Kendrick and Drake has glorified negative examples of hatred and unrighteous relationships that are a detriment to the Black community and misaligned with Jesus&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dee-1 also released an uncompromising response to “Watch the Party Die” in the form a track titled “Call It Like It Is”.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1<br>
But I will—<br>
<strong>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t care what these people think, I&rsquo;m trying to make these people think<br>
What&rsquo;s up, Kendrick?</strong> We flippin&rsquo; tables, man, (Call it like it is), alright<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Y&rsquo;all done turned this culture trash, these so-called legends ain&rsquo;t no legends<br>
I don&rsquo;t care if they sold millions, are you hearin&rsquo; their message?<br>
Poisonin&rsquo; our whole community, everybody hypnotized</strong><br>
Why you think nobody respect black people? No big surprise<br>
(Call it like it is) and <strong>I love New Orleans, my city<br>
But I love God way more, I don&rsquo;t care if none of y&rsquo;all with me<br>
We celebrate bein&rsquo; stupid and everybody so gangster</strong><br>
But when you clockin&rsquo; for that white man, you be on your best behavior, hold up<br>
(Call it like it is) Yeah, most of the media people laugh<br>
Y&rsquo;all was never really, really cool before you got inside this here game<br>
Instigating, y&rsquo;all bein&rsquo; messy, <strong>you ain&rsquo;t helping nobody grow</strong><br>
Tell Joe Budden I&rsquo;m on a mission, so don&rsquo;t butt in, Joe<br>
Man, I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; (Call it like it is), no, it ain&rsquo;t no pressure on me<br>
I&rsquo;m applyin&rsquo; the pressure, <strong>I&rsquo;m powered by G-O-D<br>
And we gon&rsquo; be alright, that&rsquo;s what Kendrick Lamar said</strong><br>
And in the words of Lil Wayne, the sky is the limit, yeah<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>So call it like it is, call it what it ain&rsquo;t</strong><br>
Call it what you want, no, I ain&rsquo;t on that train<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; from the soul, and I don&rsquo;t care who feel&rsquo; it<br>
Yeah, hip-hop is dead, and y &lsquo;all the ones who killed it</strong><br>
No, I am not impressed nah, and I say that with my chest (Uh-huh)<br>
Don&rsquo;t try to call me preaching, refer to me as blessed<br>
So call it like it is and call it what it ain&rsquo;t (ain&rsquo;t)<br>
So call it what you want (want), no, I ain&rsquo;t on that train<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Y&rsquo;all boys claim to be some soldiers<br>
But you soldiers ain&rsquo;t no soldiers</strong>, man, I told you and I showed you<br>
I&rsquo;m a soldier for life, stop playin&rsquo; dumb, <strong>it&rsquo;s good versus evil, it&rsquo;s only two sides</strong><br>
Class in session, y&rsquo;all need to attend, just like my shoe size<br>
Murder music hit different when somebody in my crew died<br>
The biggest gangsters in rap got blonde hair &rsquo;n&rsquo; blue eyes<br>
<strong>We gettin&rsquo; pimped, what y&rsquo;all wanna do, guys?<br>
Your new single just dropped? (Yeah) Time to entertain us with new lies</strong><br>
Whoever said I&rsquo;m canceled, man, I&rsquo;m laughing in these people&rsquo;s face<br>
<strong>I work for God, dummy, my impact could never be erased</strong><br>
Tell America, <strong>I&rsquo;m the same brother I used to be<br>
Before y&rsquo;all was introduced to me, consistency ain&rsquo;t new to me</strong><br>
(So call it like it is) <strong>Y&rsquo;all just sold us all with your foolery<br>
And that dollar bill got y &lsquo;all whipped</strong>, that&rsquo;s dead, man, it&rsquo;s the eulogy<br>
And <strong>whoever said what they gon&rsquo; do to me?<br>
Man, I hit your whole block up with prayers, man, y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t used to me</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick does not ask what Dee-1 would do. Given Dee-1&rsquo;s consistent, uncompromising commitment to Jesus&rsquo;s teaching above Black identity, hip hop culture, personal grievances or revolutionary philosophies, Kendrick probably knows that Dee-1 would &ldquo;show &rsquo;em just what prayer do&rdquo; without a second thought.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick sees within Dee-1 an empathetic, Christ-centered heart that Kendrick has deep inside of himself even while his hardened exterior has led him to advocate for killing the killers, burning the whole village, mortifying family members, cracking skulls, imposing agony, decapitating those who oppose him.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This contradiction between Kendricks Christian-leaning heart and his tendencies towards violence (or at least existing in an environment of violence) is a major theme of Kendrick&rsquo;s work throughout his discography.</p>

      <h4 id="i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--speaking-from-the-heart">&ldquo;I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1&rdquo; &gt; Speaking from the heart<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--speaking-from-the-heart">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is worth noting that according to Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, it is not possible for someone to have a truly empathetic heart if that persons words and actions are not consistently empathetic.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same speech from St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel where Jesus taught his disciples the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Jesus used a metaphor of trees and fruit to teach his disciples that people who have good in their heart will produce good words and actions and anyone who had evil in their heartwill produce evil words and actions. By contrast, anyone who produces evil words and actions does not truly have good in their hearts.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Beware of false prophets</strong>, who come to you <strong>in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are greedy wolves</strong>. <strong>By their fruits you will know them</strong>. Can you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, <strong>every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit</strong>. Every tree that doesn&rsquo;t grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.</em><br>
-Matthew 7:15-20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a parallel speech in St. Lluke&rsquo;s account of the Gospel according, Jesus gives the same teaching while specifically using the word heart.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from the abundance that fills a person&rsquo;s heart.</strong></em><br>
-Luke 6:43-45</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s warning against false, corrupt prophets is particularly notable given that on “Mortal Man”, throughout “DAMN.” and on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick has spoken about how he is prophet to the Black community in America.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, from the perspective of Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, Kendrick&rsquo;s inconsistent actions and words—particularly within &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;—would seem to indicate that there is a deep inconsistency within Kendrick&rsquo;s heart as Kendrick&rsquo;s heart seems to contain both empathy and a pathological desire for ruthless vigilante retribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Unexpectedly, Kendrick never finishes this line. He seems to be censoring himself. We are thus left to guess what Kendrick intended to say (“Dee-1” could be rhymed with “gun”).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, the specifics of what the uncensored line might not be that important. Thus far, all the lines on the verses have been advocating for the use of violence to execute people who Kendrick judges to be detrimental to society. Almost surely, the uncensored line would have continued the same trend. The more interesting question is why amongst all the lines that contained profanity and violence, Kendrick picked this line to censor.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The censorship here could convey the idea that the uncensored line would have been so extremely violent and direct that it would make the song “X-rated”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous time that Kendrick got so specific about the way that he would kill killer was on the track “XXX.” where Kendrick rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap<br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that”</em><br>
<strong>X-rated</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Dee-1 does not use profanity or advocate for people to commit acts of violence, Kendrick&rsquo;s tendency towards X-rated content again positions Kendrick as someone who is in many ways the exact opposite of Dee-1.</p>

<li>
<p>After previously referring to his execution targets as “degenerates” Kendrick continues to escalate his rhetoric by seemingly referring to them as “devils”. Labeling his execution targets as &ldquo;devils&rdquo; again seems to be an attempt to justify certain groups of people with a sword, potentially involving more decapitations.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Heavy metal” is a subgenre of rock music which tends to feature violent and spiritually dark imagery in the song lyrics and band names.<br>

<p>The original meaning of “heavy metals” refers to a category of chemical elements from the periodic table of elements. Kendrick thus seems to be making a subtle reference to his song “ELEMENT.” where he justified and glorified using violence to take revenge and fight against his enemies.</p>

      <h4 id="its-time-to-get-these-devils-out-the-way-heavy-metals-on-my-sword--spiritual-swordfights">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword&rdquo; &gt; Spiritual swordfights<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-time-to-get-these-devils-out-the-way-heavy-metals-on-my-sword--spiritual-swordfights">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that in St. Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Church in Ephesus, St. Paul uses the imagery of armor, swords and warfare as a metaphor to describe how Christians should fight against spiritual forces including the &ldquo;devi&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) and the “element” forces of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. <strong>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the methodology of the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”]</strong>. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but <strong>against the element</strong>, against the powers, <strong>against the world&rsquo;s rulers of the darkness of this age</strong>, and <strong>against the spiritual forces of wickedness</strong> in the heavenly places.<br>
 <br>
Therefore <strong>put on the whole armor of God</strong>, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of right relationships, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News (aka Gospel) of peace, above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to <strong>quench all the fiery darts of the evil one</strong>. And take the helmet of salvation, and <strong>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</strong>; with all prayer and requests, <strong>praying at all times in the Spirit</strong>, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints.</em><br>
 <br>
-Ephesians 6:10-18</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that passage, St. Paul makes it clear that Christians are not meant to be fighting or killing other humans (or as St. Paul says “flesh and blood”), because other humans are never the real enemy. Instead, St. Paul instructs the member of the church to go to war against “spiritual forces of wickedness”, not the humans who are doing things that are “too wicked to apologize”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to defend against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to put on “spiritual armor” which refers to virtues such as truth, right relationships, peace derived from Jesus&rsquo;s Good News, faith, salvation.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to fight offensively against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to wield “the sword of the Spirit” which is a metaphor for the “word of God” that is conveyed though Jesus&rsquo;s teachings as told in the texts of Bible.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St. Paul also instructs Christians to fight the spiritual war “with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, in St. Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul made it clear that Christians are not meant to use physical weapons to fight against human enemies but spiritual weapons to fight against prideful patterns and thoughts and arguments which attempt to exalt themselves to make mak humans act according to those prideful patterns of thoughts and arguments instead of obeying Jesus&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li>For though we walk in the [flesh / body], <strong>we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires]</strong>, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. <strong>We are destroying arguments and all pride that exalts itself against the knowledge of God</strong>, and we are <strong>taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ</strong>.<br>
-2 Corinthians 10:3-5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, St. Paul clearly teaches Christians to “show &rsquo;em what prayer do”. Moreover, St. Paul also instructs Christians to be transformed by Jesus&rsquo;s teaching so that they can develop the kinds of virtues that will allow them to fight against prideful thoughts and arguments that would justify wickedness, including any acuments that would justify brutally killing other humans.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“Hard” seems to be connected to the idea of “heavy metal” on the previous line. These “hard disputes” seem to be part of some unresolvable marital conflict that will eventually end in divorce. Based on the context of the song, it would seem that Kendrick plans to settle these “hard disputes” by killing the people with whom he has a dispute.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the reference to a “ghetto Hollywood divorce”, suggests that the dispute could be “contract dispute” between Black artists and an entertainment industry company.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Kendrick seems to be commenting on the relationship that “corporate guys” and “rappers who tell the lies” have forged to profit from distributing fabricated stories about being “street niggas just like Hollywood has profited from distributing fabricated stories.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also seems to be alluding to the Outkast song “Hollywood Divorce”, in which Outkast, Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg used the image of a volatile Hollywood celebrity marriage as an extended metaphor for how entertainment industries appropriate Black culture only to later divorce themselves from the Black artists while holding on to the profits and intellectual property.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Starts off like a small town marriage</strong><br>
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage<br>
<strong>Now all the stars have cars, success of course<br>
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
And I&rsquo;m a star<br>
Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t have to go to Hollywood<br>
&lsquo;Cause <strong>Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on<br>
I really think they&rsquo;re stealing from us like a sample song<br>
I really wish one day we&rsquo;d take it back like Hammer&rsquo;s home</strong><br>
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home<br>
And all I got in return was a durn country song<br>
This whole country wrong<br>
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on<br>
And cut your mic on but you don&rsquo;t even write songs<br>
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra<br>
I&rsquo;m so not sober, I&rsquo;m high like a Hollywood<br>
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller<br>
Hold up, your grill&rsquo;s glistenin&rsquo;<br>
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different<br>
What&rsquo;s the real sense of it?<br>
<strong>Bling bling, I know and did you know<br>
I&rsquo;m the creator of the term</strong>, I just straightened the perm<br>
They let it sit too long, they just makin&rsquo; it burn<br>
<strong>Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn<br>
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece</strong><br>
That&rsquo;s why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease<br>
And I be&rsquo;s the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze<br>
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne<br>
But in Hollywood it&rsquo;s Litt-le Wayne, don&rsquo;t make me none<br>
So <strong>that&rsquo;s why I got a pre-nup</strong><br>
I do<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I do, love you but you hate me at the same time</strong><br>
Lights, camera, action, it&rsquo;s game time<br>
<strong>Do you take this here as your lovely wife?<br>
To love her and cherish her for all your life?<br>
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there<br>
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s been a long time, we walked a thin line<br>
Others say they got you, but you been mine<br>
As I sit back and watch all the catfights<br>
<strong>Domestic violence — is that right?</strong><br>
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight<br>
And now I&rsquo;m growin&rsquo; up, showin&rsquo; up, blowin&rsquo; up<br>
<strong>I never ever thought that we would separate at all<br>
But you played me like a game of football<br>
Used to feed me, need me, dress me<br>
Now it&rsquo;s so messy, straight cut out and left me</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>(Starts off like a small town marriage)<br>
Hollywood divorce<br>
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing</strong><br>
(Lively wife and life, baby carriage)<br>
<strong>Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap<br>

Not even talkin&rsquo; about music<br>
Everything else, too<br>

But it&rsquo;s cool<br>
<strong>We just keep it goin&rsquo; and make new shit<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>With the line, “the culture bred with carnivores”, Kendrick seems to be alluding to the famously influential lines from Jay-Z&rsquo;s 2001 song “Izzo” in which Jay-Z describe corporate leaders in the music industry as “vultures” who scavenge off Black culture</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I do this for my culture</strong>, to let &rsquo;em know<br>
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster<br>
<strong>Show &rsquo;em how to move in a room full of vultures<br>
Industry shady</strong>, it need to be taken over<br>
<strong>Label owners hate me</strong>, I&rsquo;m raisin&rsquo; the status quo up<br>
I&rsquo;m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush<br>
<strong>Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us</strong><br>
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>More recently in Migos&rsquo;s 2017 track, “T-Shirt” from their album “Culture”, Migos member, Quavo, referenced those lines from “Izzo” while discussing how &ldquo;vultures&rdquo; will &ldquo;bite&rdquo;, which is slang for stealing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it for the culture (Culture)<br>
They gon&rsquo; bite like vultures (Vultures)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carnivores that Kendrick mention here thus seem to be culture vultures who will eat artists for a snack. Kendrick specifically mentions that the carnivores will &ldquo;eat your face&rdquo;, which conveys the idea that cultures vultures seek to erase an artist&rsquo;s identity along with any associate or credit that the artist would have to their work.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the phrase “bred with carnivores”, the word &ldquo;bred&rdquo; primarily refers to the reproduction of vulture from one generation to the next. However, &ldquo;bred&rdquo; is also a double entendre for the food item “bread” which connects to the idea of vulture eating. This line then turns into a triple entendre when we realize that “bread” is also slang for “money” which would indicate that the &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; from the entertainment industry are eating up all the money that rightfully belongs to the artist.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;Say hello to your future fate&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be asserting that getting eaten and erased by culture vultures is guaranteed to be the fate of any artist who remains trapped in the grip of the entertainment industry for any substatial amount of time.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be warning other hip hop artists about the hard disputes and metaphorical divorce that will happen to them in the future if they sign a contract with an exploitative entertainment company.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word &ldquo;forged&rdquo; refers to a fake signature that is used to establihs a fraudulent legal agreement but is also double entendre referring to the process of shaping metal into a weapon, tool or object. This connects back to previous line about “heavy metals on my sword” that was used to &ldquo;get these devils out the way&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that the signatures are being “forged” indicates that the &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; in the entertainment industry are actually committing acts of fraud to illegally profit from &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and use the leverage of paid lawyers and the legal system against Black artists.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The imagery of signatures from the entertainment industry also brings to mind the <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> track “For Sale? (Interlude)” in which Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) comes to Kendrick in the form of a music industry executive named Lucy. Lucy tries to get Kendrick to sign a contract to sell his soul to her in exchange for wealth, possessions and an agreement that Kendrick will stop praying and abandon his loving relationship with God the Father.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My name is Lucy, Kendrick</strong>, you introduced me, Kendrick<br>
Usually I don&rsquo;t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick<br>
Lucy give you no worries, <strong>Lucy got million stories<br>
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; fill your pockets<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; move your mama out of Compton<br>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br>
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty</strong>, avoiding me?<br>
It&rsquo;s not so easy, <strong>I&rsquo;m at these functions accordingly</strong><br>
Kendrick, Lucy don&rsquo;t slack a minute, Lucy work harder<br>
<strong>Lucy gon&rsquo; call you even when Lucy know you love your Father<br>
I&rsquo;m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly<br>
Lucy don&rsquo;t mind, &lsquo;cause at the end of the day you&rsquo;ll pursue me</strong><br>
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front<br>
<strong>Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork</strong><br>
I want you to know that Lucy got you<br>
All your life I watched you<br>
And now you all grown up to <strong>sign this contract</strong>,<br>
if that&rsquo;s possible</em></li>

<ul>
<li>The word &ldquo;drop&rdquo; refers to Kendrick releasing or “dropping” a new album, which is something that had been heavily anticipated during and after the battle with Drake.<br>
 </li>
<li>After hearing about sexual predators, unfaithful corporate partners, fraudulent devils and culture vultures in the entertainment industry it is no wonder that Kendrick is unenthusiastic about dropping a new album.<br>
 </li>
<li>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick would release his next full length album, <em>GNX</em>. Throughout <em>GNX</em> Kendrick discusse the challenges of navigating through the evil, satanic control of the entertainment industry, particular on the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After focusing on the justification for committing acts of physical violence against his enemies, it is notable that this is the first time on either verse where Kendrick has really focused on how he is being tested and tried spiritually.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be expressing the idea that he and other true artists face increasingly difficult struggles and trials as they become increasingly famous and visible to the public.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line expresses a similar idea and ethos to the Notorious B.I.G., Ma$e and Diddy’s famous song “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I don&rsquo;t know what they want from me<br>
It&rsquo;s like <strong>the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge of being tried spiritually seems to be one of the main reasons that Kendrick is &ldquo;not enthused to drop&rdquo; a new album, since droping a new album will only increase his visibility and his trials.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of increased spiritually trials coming after increased visibility is also illustrated in Gospel accounts which describe how Jesus was tried by the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accusers&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;] immediately after God the Father opened the skies, spoke audibly to declare that Jesus was his &ldquo;beloved son&rdquo; and  sent the Holy Spirit in the visible form of a dove to show that Jesus is the anointed king (aka the Christ) over God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>After Jesus was baptized</strong>, he came up immediately from the water; and behold, the <strong>skies were opened</strong>, and he <strong>saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him</strong>, and behold, a voice from the skies said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” <strong>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil</strong>.</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For the last few lines Kendrick has been shown himself to be very cynical about the entertainment industry, which gobbles up artists like vultures. Artists who recognize the dangers of the entertainment industry are understandably afraid and even “petrified”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the word &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; can be used as a synonym for &ldquo;afraid&rdquo;, the most concreate meaning of “petrified” refers to any kind of organic plant or animal material that is turned into stone. Organic material is petrified when water brings small minerals into the formerly living plant or animal and slowly replaces all of the organic flesh with rock-hard material.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming “petrified” actually serves as a great metaphor for hip hop as a living, flexible, organic culture being infiltrated by slick corporate guys and entertainment companies who kill hip hop artists (or more specifically kill hip hop artists consciousness as Kendrick mentioned in “Worldwide Steppers”) then seek to replace the flexible, organic culture of hip hop with a rock hard, inflexible, inorganic focus on making profit. This process eventually turns Black artists into hard-hearted individuals who are deadened to the world and can no longer grow.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that the within the Old Testament, the Prophet Ezekiel explained that God had allowed the Israelites to be defeated, dispursed and enslaved because of they had hearts of stone which did not desire God or the justice that comes from God. However, Ezekiel also prophesied about a day in the future when God would free them from slavery, bring them back to their own land and transform their old hearts of stone into new hearts of flesh which would truly desire God and be able to act with justice.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>For <strong>I will</strong> take you from among the nations and <strong>gather you</strong> out of all the countries, and will <strong>bring you into your own land</strong>. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and <strong>from all your idols</strong>. I will also <strong>give you a new heart</strong>, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will <strong>take away the heart of stone</strong> out of your bodies, and I will <strong>give you a heart of flesh</strong>. I will put my Spirit within you, and <strong>cause you to walk in my prescriptions</strong>. You will <strong>obey my justice and do just acts</strong>. You will reside in the land that I gave to your fathers. <strong>You will be my people, and I will be your God</strong>.</em><br>
-Ezekiel 36:24-28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a biblical pespective, becoming &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; is thus equivalent to being enslaved or imprisoned by an oppressor due to idolatrous desire for material possessions.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the analysis of the line <a href="#burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">&ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time&rdquo;</a>, Jezebel was a wicked woman who became queen of the Northern Kingdom of Israel after she married a wicked king named Ahab.After becoming queen, Jezebel replaced the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with the worship of the fertility god name Ba’al. Queen Jezebel then either killed or imprisoned most of the true prophets of God, while a hundred of God&rsquo;s prophets escaped to hide in caves.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>The prophet Elijah was the only prophet who was protected and empowered to openly confront Queen Jezebel and King Ahab. Elijah challenged the prophets of the fertility Ba’al to a competition to in which the prophets of Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Ba’al, the fertility god, would each ask the deity whom they worshiped to send down fire from the skies to burn up a sacrifice on an altar.<br>
 </li>
<li>After Yahweh, the God of Israel, proved to be the only deity capable of sending down fire from the skies, Elijah compelled the Israelites to round up the prophets of Ba’al and kill them.<br>
 </li>
<li>The death of Ba&rsquo;al&rsquo;s prophets enraged Queen Jezebel. Shen then swore that she would kill Elijah, which caused Elijah to run for his life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet on “Mortal Man”, throughout DAMN. and at severl moments on other tracks. Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick the seems see himself as the modern equivalent of the prophet Elijah who is at risk of having his artistic output locked up by the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The term &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; is used to describe a person who is noticeably being under the influence of drugs, whether prescription drugs or recreational drugs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases, someone who is &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; may not be fully aware of their surroundings and thus is in a vulernable state in which someone could take advantage of them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of being drugged up connects back to the earlier reference to the drug MDMA in the line &ldquo;Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current line, Kendrick seems to imply that artists who are have succumbed to their desires from pleasure and the exploitation of the entertainment industry will be drugged up with &ldquo;lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of artists being under the influence of lies also connects back to earlier lines where Kendrick ordered the execution of those who told lies or failed to provide truth to their young audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you parade in gluttony <strong>without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth</strong><br>
The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose<br>
&hellip;<br>
I think it’s time to watch the party die<br>
Street niggas and the corporate guys<br>
the <strong>rappers that report the lies</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current line, Kendrick seems to suggest that the minds of &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; eventually become altered and distorted as they become intoxicated by the lies that they have consumed and are not regurgitating to the masses.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; may also lead a person to lose consciousness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fittingly, since the 1990s the word “conscious” has been used to describe hip hop artists such as Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Lupe Fiasco who do not gloryify violence, drugs, sexual misbehavior, gluttony, jewelry, poor financial decisions, or any other form of ignorance that might be common in commercialized, mainstream hip hop. Instead, these artists focused on positive messages that would uplift the Black community. &ldquo;Conscious&rdquo; hip hop artists are thus the exact opposite of the &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and become &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Stepper</em> Kendrick also discussed the concept of &ldquo;conciousness&rdquo; as being free from ego, aware, present in &ldquo;now&rdquo;, and connected to the universal or &ldquo;collective consciousness&rdquo; as described in the New Age teachings of Eckhart Tolle.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>media</strong>&rsquo;s the new religion, you <strong>killed the consciousness</strong></em>
-“Worldwide Steppers”<br>
 <br>
<em>(You really wanna know?) Do you want peace?<br>
(How I get so low?) Then watch us in the street<br>
(Only one way to go) One protest for you<br>
(Higher) Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)<br>
Vladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)<br>
But <strong>that&rsquo;s how we all think</strong> (Only one way to go)<br>
<strong>The collective conscious</strong> (Higher)<br>
Calamities on repeat, huh</em><br>
-“Savior”<br>
 <br>
*Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here<br>
Where the energy is magnified and persevered<br>
*<em>Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear<br>
Euphoria is glorified and made His</em><br>
-“The Heart Part 5”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases the term, &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; or just &ldquo;drugged&rdquo; may also be used to describe women (or sometimes men) who have unknowingly consumed a drug that was given to them by a sexual predator who intends to sexually assault or abuse the &ldquo;drugged&rdquo; person once they lose awareness or consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sexual assault could imply that rappers and artists are being &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo; because they are being &ldquo;fucked over&rdquo; by the predatory leaders of the entertainment industry. Kendrick previously asserted that artists are getting duped into unfaithful relationships, &ldquo;fucked over&rdquo;, and killed by the entertainment industry on the track &ldquo;N95&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Stepper</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The industry wants<br>
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box</strong><br>
While <strong>they makin&rsquo; a mockery followin&rsquo; us</strong><br>
This ain&rsquo;t Monopoly<br>
Watchin&rsquo; for love<br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t monogamy<br>
Y&rsquo;all gettin&rsquo; fucked</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sexual assault could also connect back to Kendrick allegagions of Drake and his crew being sexual predators who traffic girls to sex parties at Drake&rsquo;s mansion.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Here Kendrick talks about being pitiful and in the “Sunken Place”, which is a reference to the movie <strong>Get Out</strong>.<br>
    </p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Get Out</em> a Black male protagonist named Chris goes to visit his white girlfriend&rsquo;s wealthy family at a secluded estate. Although the family is very friendly—actually too friendly—he begins to notice strange behavior, particularly from the Black woman who serves as housekeeper and the Black man who serves as a groundskeeper.<br>
 </li>
<li>One evening, the Black protagonist has a private conversation with his white girlfriend’s mother. The mother starts asking very probing questions about his personal trauma while using the sound of a spoon stirring around a teacup to hypnotize the Black protagonist.<br>
 </li>
<li>As he talks about his traumatic life experiences the Black protagonist feels pitiful and soon becomes paralyzed and cannot move even though he is still awake. However, then the mother says “Now sink into the floor. Sink!”<br>
 </li>
<li>At that point the Black protagonist’s consciousness becomes totally disconnected or dissociated from his body and sent down to what the mother calls “the sunken place”. In the “sunken place” he faintly see what’s going on around him but is unable to move his body or do anything about it.<br>
 </li>
<li>Later on the White mother keeps the Black protagonist in the hypnotized state long enough to strap him to a restraining chair in the basement. The Black protagonist then learns that the family uses the daughter to attract black people and bring them to her family’s estate where they are hypnotized with the consciousness sent to the sunken place. The family then takes over the Black person’s body and transfers the consciousness of older, “degenerate” White person into the Black person’s stolen body stolen body.<br>
 </li>
<li>The protagonists learns that Black woman who is serving as the housekeeper and the Black man who is serving as the groundskeeper are Black people whose bodies were previously stolen so that their consciousness could be replaced by the consciousness of the girlfriend’s grandmother and grandfather respectively.<br>
 </li>
<li>The Black protagonist refuses to be a victim of this plot. He manages to free himself from the restraining chair before his body is stolen and kill several members of the family before escaping from the estate with the help of his Black friend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be referencing the plot of <em>Get Out</em> as a metaphor for what the White-owned entertainment industry is doing to Black artists and Black culture.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The White owned entertainment industry is sending out corporate White folks to attract Black artists to come join the the White entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Black artist is in the building, the White industry folks hypnotize and paralyze Black artists by getting them to keep talking about their traumatic life experiences until they feel pitiful.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is similar to the experiences that Kendrick alluded to on “Mother I Sober” when he rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Traded in my tears for a Range Rover”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The White industry folk then forces the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness (aka the &ldquo;Sunken Place&rdquo;) where they become disconnected and dissociated from what’s going on around them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After forcing the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness, the White corporate industry folk can then steal the Black artist’s body of work (e.g. the master recording of a music artist) and give it to a degenerate White person to own as his or her own body of work while the Black artist is still trapped in the “Sunken Place”.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>It is notable that the word “corporate” comes from the Latin word “corporātiō” which literally means “the assumption or taking on of a body”<br>
 </li>
<li>This idea of stealing a Black artist&rsquo;s body (of work) also mirrors the metaphor of petrification where White corporate industry folk kill the Black artist’s consciousness, penetrate into their body of work, and slowly replace the flexible, organic flesh with rock hard, inflexible, inorganic minerals until the body is just a hard relic of a past life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick, like the protagonists of Get Out is one of the few Black artists who has been able to regain consciousness, free himself from the restraints of his original contract, and now seems poised to kill the White industry folk so that he can escape before they try to send his consciousness back to the &ldquo;Sunken Place.&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick finds himself in the &ldquo;Sunken Place&rdquo; whenever he “questions his pride”. The might convey the idea that the entertainment industry wants Kendrick to remain under the influence of his own pride, so that he will make bad decisions and be easier to control.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has discussed his internal struggle between pride and humility throughout much of his work.</p>
<ul>

<p>A &ldquo;relapse&rdquo; is a setback in deteriation in someone&rsquo;s health after previous improvement. The term is most often used to describe the experience in which someone who had previously broken free from an addiction to a drug or stimulating activity returns to their addiction.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; a &ldquo;relapsin&rsquo; one thought at a time&rdquo; might imply that the spiritual and physical struggles with the entertainment industry are causing Kendrick to fall back into destructive ways of thought after previously being &ldquo;drugged up full of lies.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that throughout <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick reveals his struggle with sex addition that was exacerbated by being a famous touring artist in the entertainment industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I met her on the third night of Chicago<br>

<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to realize that his susceptibility to addition is fueled by his own pattern of thoughts. This echoes St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians in which he told Chrsitians that they are not fighting a physical battle against other humans but a spiritual battle against arrogant thoughts and arguments that lead to prideful exaltation and prevent humans from knowing God in a loving relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For though we walk in the [flesh / body], <strong>we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires]</strong>, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. <strong>We are destroying arguments and all arrogance that exalts itself against the knowledge of God</strong>, and we are <strong>taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ</strong>.</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “spare no feelings” describes someone who is acting without any concern of how his or her actions could hurt someone else’s feelings.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick’s relapse seems to have put him into a mental state where he only cares about his own feelings and no longer cares about the feelings of others. Such a state of mind is the exact opposite of empathy and thus undermines the earlier line when he said “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1”<br>
 </p>

<p>Kendrick previously expressed his paranoid, troubled and unempathetic state of mind when he was overwhelmed by his feelings on the track “FEEL.” from <em>DAMN.</em>.</p>

I feel niggas tappin&rsquo; they pockets<br>
I feel like debatin&rsquo; on who the greatest can stop it<br>
<strong>I am legend, I feel like all of y&rsquo;all is peasants<br>
I feel like all of y&rsquo;all is desperate</strong><br>

Mike Jordan whenever holdin&rsquo; a real mic<br>
<strong>I ain&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; your presence<br>
Feel like I&rsquo;ma learn you a lesson</strong><br>
Feel like only me and the music though<br>
<strong>I feel like your feelin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t mutual<br>
I feel like the enemy you should know</strong><br>
Feel like the feelin&rsquo; of no hope<br>
The feelin&rsquo; of bad dope<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I feel like it&rsquo;s just me</strong><br>
Look, I feel like I can&rsquo;t breathe<br>
Look, I feel like I can&rsquo;t sleep<br>
Look, I feel heartless, often off this<br>
Feelin&rsquo; of fallin&rsquo;, of fallin&rsquo; apart with<br>
Darkest hours, lost it<br>

I feel like this gotta be the feelin&rsquo; where &lsquo;Pac was<br>
The feelin&rsquo; of an apocalypse happenin&rsquo;<br>
But nothin&rsquo; is awkward, the feelin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t prosper<br>
<strong>The feelin&rsquo; is toxic, I feel like I&rsquo;m boxin&rsquo; demons<br>
Monsters, false prophets schemin&rsquo;<br>
Sponsors, industry promises<br>
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton<br>
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage<br>
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert<br>

I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us<br>
I can feel it, the dream is more than process<br>
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness<br>
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic<br>
<strong>I feel like sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;, I feel like takin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;<br>
I feel like skatin&rsquo; off, I feel like waitin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em<br>

I feel like the whole world want me to pray for &rsquo;em<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To be “in one’s feelings” refers to a mental state in which someone is so emotionally dysregulated, overwhelmed or affected that they can no longer think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that “In My Feelings” is also the title of Drake&rsquo;s record-breaking number one single from his 2018 album, <em>Scorpion</em>. On the track, Drake sings and raps about many of his typical themes including his feelings and sexual desire for numerous women.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap, TrapMoneyBenny<br>
<strong>This shit got me in my feelings</strong>*<br>
Gotta be real with it, yeah<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Kiki, do you love me?</strong> Are you riding?<br>
Say you&rsquo;ll never ever leave from beside me<br>
<strong>&lsquo;Cause I want ya, and I need ya</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m down for you always<br>
<strong>KB, do you love me?</strong> Are you riding?<br>
Say you&rsquo;ll never ever leave from beside me<br>
<strong>&lsquo;Cause I want ya, and I need ya</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m down for you always</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;In My Feelings&rdquo; also exemplifies how Drake has used social media, influencers and corporate marketing tactics to significantly increase his commercial success. On the same day that the album Scorpion was released, a social media comedian named Shiggy posted a video of him dancing to this chorus. This video soon went viral and was then turned into a the social media #InMyFeelingsChallenge and #KikiChallenge which later added riskier elements like dancing outside of moving cars. These viral trends helped to elevate the track to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart giving Drake the record for most number one hits of rapper in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the context Kendrick’s lyrics “slide” is usually slang for the act of killing someone.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I said, tell me who you loyal to<br>
Is it anybody that you would lie for?<br>
<strong>Anybody you would slide for?</strong><br>
Anybody you would die for?</em><br>
-&ldquo;LOYALTY.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>Eight billion people on Earth, <strong>silent murderers</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I caught a couple of bodies myself, <strong>slid my community</strong><br>
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies<br>
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient<br>
But <strong>because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin&rsquo;</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my feelings when I slide&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that whenever he tries to kill (aka slide) people, he is only doing so because he is emotionally dysregulated and unable to think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line thus gives a whole new perspective and context to &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;. The whole time that he has been advocating to kill the killers and commit acts of unspeakable violence may really just be evidence that Kendrick is emotionally dysregulated and unable to consider the ramifications or consequences of his words and actions. He seems to have been in a totally &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo;  state throughout this track.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the same logic, one could also conclude that throughout the battle tracks where Kendrick seemingly tried to kill Drake&rsquo;s career, Kendrick was &ldquo;in his feelings&rdquo; and unable to be empathetic towards Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; when Kendrick released the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; as the centerpiece of the album <em>GNX</em> , Kendrick seemed to confirm that his actions during the battle with Drake were largely a result of Kendrick being &ldquo;in his feelings&rdquo;. On &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; Kendrick rapped from the perspective of God the Father who told Kendrick that he was a reincarnated version of Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accusers&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;) who &ldquo;loved war&rdquo; and and was kicked out of heaven because his feelings of anxiety led him to do evil. In response, Kendrick acknowledged that all he ever really wanted was to feel &ldquo;love and approval&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;<strong>Son you do well but your heart is closed</strong><br>
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself&quot;<br>
Father I&rsquo;m not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down<br>
&ldquo;But your pride has to die, &quot;<br>
Okay father show me how<br>
&ldquo;Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for&rdquo;<br>
I kept one hundred institutions paid, &ldquo;Okay, tell me more&rdquo;<br>
I put one hundred hoods on one stage, &ldquo;Okay, tell me more&rdquo;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m tryna push peace in LA, &ldquo;But you love war&rdquo;</strong><br>
No, I don&rsquo;t, &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do, &quot; okay then tell me the truth<br>
&ldquo;Every individual is only a version of you<br>
<strong>How can they forgive when there&rsquo;s no forgiveness in your heart?</strong>&rdquo;<br>
I could tell You where I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;I could tell you who you are<br>
You fell out of heaven &lsquo;cause <strong>you was anxious</strong><br>
Didn&rsquo;t like authority, only searched to be heinous<br>
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent<br>
My greatest music director was you<br>
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues<br>
It was harmony and motion<br>
<strong>I sent you down to earth &lsquo;cause you was broken<br>
Rehabilitation not psychosis</strong><br>
But now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music<br>
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving<br>
You came a long way from garnishing evil-ish views&rdquo;<br>
And <strong>all I ever wanted from You was love and approval</strong><br>
I learned a lot, <strong>no more putting these people in fear</strong><br>
The more that word is diminished, the more it&rsquo;s not real<br>
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel<br>
I&rsquo;m using words for inspiration as an ideal<br>
&ldquo;So can you promise that you won&rsquo;t take your gifts for granted?&rdquo;<br>
I promise that I&rsquo;ll use my gifts to bring understanding<br>
&ldquo;For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?&rdquo;<br>
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now<br>
<strong>&ldquo;You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity&rdquo;<br>
And I&rsquo;m ashamed that I ever created that enemy</strong></em></li>

      <h4 id="im-in-my-feelings-when-i-slide-i-mean--toosie-slide">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my feelings when I slide, I mean&rdquo; &gt; Toosie Slide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#im-in-my-feelings-when-i-slide-i-mean--toosie-slide">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to using the word &ldquo;slide&rdquo; to refer to killing, on the battle track, &ldquo;6:16 in LA&rdquo;, Kendrick used the word &ldquo;slide&rdquo; in reference to &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo;, Drake&rsquo;s number one hit and accompanying viral dance trend from 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person<br>
Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it<br>
<strong>Can&rsquo;t Toosie Slide up outta this one</strong>, it&rsquo;s just gon&rsquo; resurface<br>
Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Drake used influencers and viral social media trends to significantly increase the commercial success of &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo; in a more enhanced version of his strategy for &ldquo;In My Feelings&rdquo; four years earlier.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Toosie Slide” was released as a single in April, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns and named after a then 23 year old named Toosie.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toosie is a Black social media dancer and influencer from Atlanta who had a big break into the music industry when he linked up with fellow Atlanta-native and rapper Future eventually joining Future on the Summer Sixteen Tour with Future, a tour which also features Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Drake needed another social media dance trend to popularize a new song, he direct messaged Toosie on social media and asked Toosie to make up a dance based on the hook of an unfinished song. That request turned into a modern “Cha Cha Slide”-style dance and viral social media video which featured the song’s hook.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fact that Drake used his connection with Atlanta native rapper, Future, and Future’s Atlanta native dancer, Toosie, also highlights the criticism that Kendrick made on “Not Like Us”. Throughout the third verse of &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; Kendrick accused Drake of colonizing Black culture particularly by using Atlanta-based artists to make commercialized hits that could make Drake rich.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Once upon a time, all of us was in chains<br>
Homie still doubled down callin&rsquo; us some slaves<br>
<strong>Atlanta was the Mecca</strong>, buildin&rsquo; railroads and trains<br>
Bear with me for a second, let me put y&rsquo;all on game<br>
<strong>The settlers was usin&rsquo; townfolk to make &rsquo;em richer<br>
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance</strong><br>
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge<br>
<strong>You called Future when you didn&rsquo;t see the club</strong> (Ayy, what?)<br>
<strong>Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up</strong> (What?)<br>
<strong>21 gave you false street cred</strong><br>
<strong>Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head</strong> (Ayy, what?)<br>
<strong>Quavo said you can be from Northside</strong> (What?)<br>
<strong>2 Chainz say you good, but he lied<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars<br>
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin&rsquo; colonizer</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Toosie’s video had already gone viral Drake released the official music video for the full song which was now titled “Toosie Slide”. The video showed Drake wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask and doing Toosi’s dance while going through a tour of his mansion during the COVID lockdown.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the surface, “Toosie Slide” seems like just a dance song with melodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Baby, don&rsquo;t you wanna dance with me?</strong> No?<br>
I could dance like Michael Jackson<br>
I could give you satisfaction<br>
And you know we out here every day with it<br>
I&rsquo;ma show you how to get it<br>
&hellip;<br>
It go <strong>right foot up, left foot, slide</strong><br>
<strong>Left foot up, right foot, slide</strong><br>
Basically, I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;, <strong>either way, we &lsquo;bout to slide</strong>, ayy<br>
<strong>Can&rsquo;t let this one slide</strong>, ayy (Who&rsquo;s bad?)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if one pays close attention to the lyrics one can hear that Drake is actually trying to “act tough” and portay himself as a &ldquo;street nigga&rdquo; as he uses the word “slide” to simultaneously refer to the dance and to the act of vengefully killing his enemies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Got so many opps</strong>, I be mistakin&rsquo; opps for other opps<br>
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots<br>
Other than the family I got, it&rsquo;s either you or me<br>
<strong>That&rsquo;s just how I think, it&rsquo;s either you or me</strong><br>
This life got too deep for you, baby<br>
<strong>Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin’</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Black leather glove, no sequins<br>
Buckles on the jacket, it&rsquo;s Alyx shit<br>
<strong>Nike crossbody, got a piece in it<br>
Got a dance, but it&rsquo;s really on some street shit</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ma show you how to get it*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on the battle track &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; Kendrick says that he would like Drake to keep making songs with catchy melodies that make everyone dance instead of trying to &ldquo;act tough&rdquo;. Kendrick even implied that if Drake focused on making dance songs, Kendrick would have no reason to threaten Drake with diss songs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I like Drake with the melodies, I don&rsquo;t like Drake when he act tough</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed<br>
<strong>Keep makin&rsquo; me dance, wavin&rsquo; my hand, and it won&rsquo;t be no threat</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the battle track &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;, Kendrick also seems to mock Drake’s attempt to make viral dance hits like “Toosie Slide” by chanting the following dance instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Let me hear you say, &ldquo;OV-ho&rdquo; (OV-ho)<br>
Say, &ldquo;OV-ho&rdquo; (OV-ho)<br>
<strong>Then step this way, step that way<br>
Then step this way, step that way</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also on the video for “Not Like Us”, there is scene where Kendrick is standing on a dark street. Just behinda Kendrick, a menacing man approaches wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask just like Drake did in the “Toosie Slide” video. However, before the man has a chance to put a hand on Kendrick the man is suddenly thrown backwards almost as if there was some kind of supernatural force protecting Kendrick.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of these references to &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo; along with the slang meaning of &ldquo;slide&rdquo; seem to suggest that Drake&rsquo;s actions over a number of years are the exact things that Kendrick has judged to be punishable by execution throughout &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick transitions away from discussion on his spiritual, physical and emotional trials withing the entertainment industry and once again wonders out loud what Lecrae would do as a Black man and a hip hop artist who has faced many similar trials and challenges.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that instead of saying “<em><strong>I</strong></em> wonder what Lecrae would do&quot;, he now says “<em><strong>a nigga</strong></em> wonder what Lecrae would do&quot;, almost as if it is a question that any Black person should be wondering.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For context, Lecrae has had to deal with his fair share of public controversy and conflict with White Christians who began to take offense at Lecrae when after Lecdrated started speaking about racial justice issues that were affecting the Black community.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because White (Evangelical) Christians represent the largest consumer demographic for Christian hip hop, speaking out about racial justice put Lecrae at odds with the White -wned entertainment industry who wanted to co-opt his music and act like they owned him. Lecraes details these dynamics on several tracks on Lecrae’s 2017 album <em>All Things Work Together for Good</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Learned a lot over these last few years<br>

<p>Terrace Martin is a hip hop producer who has worked with Kendrick to produce numerous tracks including &ldquo;Ab-Soul&rsquo;s Outro&rdquo;, &ldquo;m.A.A.d city&rdquo;, &ldquo;Real&rdquo;, &ldquo;For Free? (Interlude)&rdquo;, &ldquo;King Kunta&rdquo;, &ldquo;These Walls&rdquo;, &ldquo;For Sale?”, &ldquo;Complexion (A Zulu Love)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Complexion (A Zulu Love)&rdquo;, “untitled 05|09.21.2014”, and &ldquo;Loyalty&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given how much he has witnessed Kendrick creative process up close over multiple years and projects, Terrance Martin would know more than most people that Kendrick’s mind is always thinking on multiple layers while trying to give truth to the youth.</p>

<ul>
<li>“Flooding the market” refers to the act of releasing a large quantity of a particular product into the a particular market in a short period of time.<br>
 </li>
<li>For Kendrick, flooding the market could refer to the release of the current track and a subsequent album which would flood the music market with sales and streams. The idea of &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; music also connects to the theme of water introduced by the word &ldquo;flood&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea of a market where people pay for goods and services also connects to the idea of “paying dues”. &ldquo;Paying dues&rdquo; a phrase that refers working hard with a great deal of patience, endurance and commitment to the little things in order to earn respect and an opportunity to take on a much larger or more visible role.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While rapping from Nispey’s perspective on “The Heart Part 5”, Kendrick uses the phrase “paid dues” to describe the hard work that Nipsey Hussle put into the rap game  by releasing 13 mixtapes in 12 years from 2005 to 2017 before releasing his only studio album in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reflectin&rsquo; on my life and what I done<br>
<strong>Paid dues</strong>, made rules, change outta love<br>
Them same views made schools change curriculums</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “I paid your dues”, Kendrick would seem to be talking to someone who did not work hard to earn respect. This could be a reference to Drake, whom Kendrick has repeatedly criticized for using ghostwriters to write his rap lyrics instead of putting in the work to write his own lyrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly , on “euphoria” and “meet the grahams”, Kendrick criticized Drake for receiving Ozempic weight loss injection, having abdominal surgery to improve his appearance without needing to pay his dues by working out.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yeah, my first one like my last one, it&rsquo;s a classic, you don&rsquo;t have one<br>
Let your core audience <strong>stomach that, then tell &rsquo;em where you get your abs from</strong></em><br>
-“euphoria”<br>
 <br>
<em>Even if it don&rsquo;t benefit your goals, <strong>do some push-ups, get some discipline<br>
Don&rsquo;t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did<br>
Don&rsquo;t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership</strong></em><br>
-“meet the grahams”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “paid your dues”, Kendrick could also be saying that Drake never did the hard, therapeutic work of self-examination to understand how he needs to grow and mature. This lack of self-examination left Kendrick to do the examination work for Drake, which resulted in the astute criticisms that Kendrick made throughout all the battle tracks.</p>

<ul>
<li>By saying “it’s up”, Kendrick could be indicating that the “time is up”, which would connect back to the first line of each verse which said “It’s time to watch the party die”.<br>
 </li>
<li>Kendrick asserts that the death of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; will be bad news to those who &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t one of ours&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>Using the phrase &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t one of ours&rdquo; to refer to people outside of the community or outside of the circle of trust mirrors the core mesage of the battle track &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; where Kendrick mentions Drake and the members of Drake&rsquo;s crew by name prior to the chorus where Kenrick repeatedly said &ldquo;They not like us.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick’s hometown friend, Jay (or Jason) Estrada is Compton-native athletic fitness trainer who worked as a strength trainer for the 2016 U.S.A. Olympic basketball teams. Additionally, Jay Estrada has also trained other NBA players including Compton-native DeMar Derozan, who made a guest appearance in the “Not Like Us” video after Kendrick name dropped him in the second verse of “Not Like Us”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By working out with Jay Estrada, Kendrick is again showing himself to be someone who pays his own dues in contrast to Drake who allegedly paid for for the shortcut of Ozempic and abdominal surgery based on Kendrick&rsquo;s words to Drake&rsquo;s son on &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Even if it don&rsquo;t benefit your goals, <strong>do some push-ups, get some discipline<br>
Don&rsquo;t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did</strong><br>
Don&rsquo;t pay to play with them Brazilians, <strong>get a gym membership</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable, that Kendrick’s advice to Drake’s son to “do some push-ups” is a direct response to “Push Ups”, Drake’s initial diss track where Drake mocked Kendrick for a viral social media video which shoed Kendrick doing push-ups in a park.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drake used the image of Kendrick doing push-ups as a metaphor for Kendrick getting coerced into a disadvantageous financial situation by Top Dawg, the Black owner of Kendrick’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Drake asserted that every time Top Dawg told Kendrick to “drop” (i.e. drop to the ground as a metaphor for dropping an album), Kendrick had to give Top Dawg “fifty” (i.e. fifty push ups as a metaphor for 50% of the royalties from Kedrick’s music releases).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up<br>
&lsquo;Cause Top told you, &ldquo;Drop and give me fifty,&rdquo; like some push-ups</strong>, huh<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Pull your contract &lsquo;cause we gotta see the split<br>
The way you doin&rsquo; splits, bitch, your pants might rip</strong><br>
You better do that motherfuckin&rsquo; show inside the bity<br>
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty<br>
Then we need a verse for the Swifties<br>
<strong>Top say drop, you better drop and give &rsquo;em fifty</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Ayy, <strong>better drop and give me fifty, ayy<br>
Drop and give me fifty, drop and give me fifty</strong>, ayy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Kendrick’s perspective, by choosing to mock Kendrick for doing push up exercise and working hard for Top Dawg, Drake is exposing himself as someone who would rather cheat and sell himself to the White owned entertainment industry instead of working hard to pay his dues.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Katt William&rsquo;s viral Club Shay Shay interview that Kendrick alluded to on “meet the grahams”, Katt Wiliams made the exact same point against comics and entertainers who sold out to the White owned entertainment industry used ghostwriters and did not pay their dues or otherwise gave up on working hard. Katt Williams compared these people to athletes or body builders who use performance enhancing drugs to avoid putting in the hard work of exercising but still want people to impressed with their bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m a standup comedian. This is my nineteenth one-hundred city tour. <strong>I&rsquo;m not going to have a conversation with these lazy bums that&rsquo;ll take a shortcut at any point.

<ul>
<li>
<p>“You gotta burn it down to build it up” would seem to be a statement that Jay Estrada would make in the context of strength and fitness training.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to build stronger muscles, an athlete first has to break down the existing muscle by lifting, pressing or pulling weights or some other kind of resistance. These kinds of exercises create tiny microtears in muscle fibers that are accompanied by a burning sensation in the muscles. This burning sensation is what is being referred to by the exercise term “feel the burn”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of “burn it down to build it up” could be applied to much of the violent language that Kendrick has used when acting like a totalitarian dictator who is trying to purge society and “burn the whole village” so “we can start over” with the hope of building a “new earth”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, if we see Kendrick’s fierce criticism and exposure of Drake as a way to “burn it down to build it up”, the natural conclusion is that Kendrick actually wants Drake to be built up into a better person.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act of “tough love” is consistent with Kendrick’s words on “meet the grahams” where he explained his motives for engaging in a rap battle with Drake.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “locked in” is most often used to describe someone who is focused on their goal, which connects to the themes of paying dues and working out in the previous lines. Here Kendrick says he is focused on (i.e. locked in to) “what he trusts”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick’s rap battle with Drake started when Kendrick was featured on the song “Like That” on Future and Metro Boomin’s album titled, <em>We Don’t Trust You</em>. That album title seems to have been a statement about Drake, who the two Atlanta-native artists had previously worked with but no longer trusted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the battle, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being an actor, manipulator and liar who cannot be trusted.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The famous actor</strong> we once knew is lookin&rsquo; paranoid and now spiralin&rsquo;<br>
You&rsquo;re movin&rsquo; just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin&rsquo; distasteful<br>

<strong>Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Since Kendrick does trust Drake he looks “outside” to find what he does trust. Here “outside” seems to refer to the world around Kendrick, or maybe more specifically the city around him—the city of Compton.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association with the city of Compton being “outside” seems to be highlighted on “Not Like Us” where in quick succession Kendrick mentions Drake—the liar and false god, who need to be locked inside (a jail cell)—in contrast to the city that is free to be outside.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Devil is a lie, he a 69 God</strong>, ayy<br>
<strong>Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside</strong>, ayy<br>
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of &lsquo;za, ayy<br>
<strong>City is back up, it&rsquo;s a must, we outside</strong>, ayy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The music video of &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; further emphisizes the contrast between the city of Compton being free outside with numerous shots of large crowds filling the plaza of the Compton City Hall and Civic Center while Drake&rsquo;s OVO owl is locked up inside a birdcage. Notably, the owl in the birdcage is shown in the second to last shot right before the video cuts back a final shot of the large crowd dancing at the Compton City Hall and Civic Center under a sculture dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr..</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick ends that song by declaring that at some point between the beginning and end of this song, Kendrick has watched the party die, likely as a result of Kendrick&rsquo;s execution orders.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the party—which will not go on tomorrow—,Kendrick highlights the kids who are now able to live tomorrow.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mention of kids is likely a reference to Kendrick’s allegation that Drake and his crew were trafficking underaged girls to for Drake and his crew to have sex with at parities. At the same time, uncompromising artists such as Katt Williams has sought to expose that powerful men engaging in predatory sexual behavior is a widespread, endemic problem throughout the entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The future for kids has been a central focus for Kendrick since he became a father as can be seen throughout <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper</em>’s theme of breaking generational curses - particularly curses that related to sexual abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Playin&rsquo; &ldquo;Baby Shark&rdquo; with my daughter<br>

<em>Family ties, <strong>they accused my cousin, &ldquo;Did he touch you, Kendrick?&rdquo;</strong><br>
Never lied, but <strong>no one believed me when I said &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Did he touch you?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No&rdquo; again, still they didn&rsquo;t believe me</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I asked my momma why she didn&rsquo;t believe me when I told her &ldquo;No&rdquo;<br>

Though it never happened, she wouldn&rsquo;t agree<br>

Amplified as I write this song, I shiver &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m nervous<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I pray our children don&rsquo;t inherit me and feelings I attract<br>
A conversation not bein&rsquo; addressed in Black families<br>
The devastation, hauntin&rsquo; generations and humanity<br>
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters<br>
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other<br>
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain&rsquo;t recovered<br>
Still livin&rsquo; as victims</strong> in the public eyes who pledge allegiance<br>
<strong>Every other brother has been compromised<br>
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused<br>
I see &rsquo;em daily buryin&rsquo; they pain in chains and tattoos</strong><br>
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move<br>
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school<br>
His anger grows deep in misogyny<br>
<strong>This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active</strong><br>
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made<br>
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame<br>
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother&rsquo;s pain<br>
I hope Hykeem made you proud &lsquo;cause you ain&rsquo;t die in vain<br>
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all<br>
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God<br>
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred<br>
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation<br>

<li>
<p>Lecrae&rsquo;s track “Die for the Party” features the exact same beat as Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s “Watch the Party Die”. As Lecrae mentions here, “Die for the Party” is meant to serve as an additional verse for “Watch the Party Die”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae decided to release this verse on his own rather than Kendrick inviting him to do so as part of a remix or extended version. That being said, on two separate lines within the third verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick did say that he wondered “what Lecrae would do”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do<br>
Fuck these niggas up or show &rsquo;em just what prayer do?<br>
&hellip;<br>
A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae thus seems to have reasonably concluded that those two lines from “Watch the Party Die” were an open invitation for him to write and release his verse on &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lecrae here makes a reference to the Jay-Z’s classic and often quoted lines from the 2001 track “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” where Kendricks challenges the status quo of the music industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I do this for my culture, to let &rsquo;em know<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick also makes a subtle reference to these exact lines from &ldquo;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, the phrase “clout-chasing” is used to describe a person who seeks attention, fame, or influence, often by engaging in behavior that attracts public interest or aligns that themself with popular trends or influential figures.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases, rappers are accused of “clout-chasing” when they directly name more famous hip hop artists in order to associate themselves with more famous artist without actually being invited to collaborate with the such famous artist.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Clout chasers&rdquo; can be seen as a form of “culture vulture” since &ldquo;clout chasers&rdquo; are metaphorically scavenging off of someone else who has been “killing it” rather than using their own skills, discipline or hard work to eat what they kill. Thus, &ldquo;clout chasing&rdquo; is also a way for someone to avoid &ldquo;paying dues&rdquo; or working hard, as Kendrick mentioned in the first verse.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on the battle track &ldquo;THE HEART PART 6&rdquo;, Drake accused Kendrick of &ldquo;clout chasing&rdquo; as Drake denied Kendrick&rsquo;s allegations that Drake was involved in pedophilia and sex trafficing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Album droppin&rsquo; soon, no wonder <strong>you turn to a clout chaser &lsquo;stead of doin&rsquo; hard labor</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae suggests that “culture vulture” rappers turn to &ldquo;clout-chasing&rdquo; in order to “prove their worth”. This psychological need to prove one’s own worth through success as a rapper is a vice with which Lecrae has personally struggled even as he is learning to find his identity in who God made him to be.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During Lecrae’s own <a href="https://youtu.be/y2ZC1FEk87Q?si=-DgVA8e6vesTqSTw&amp;t=1195">The Deep End</a> podcast episode where he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake, Lecrae concluded that the main problem with the battle was that both rappers were trying to tear down their rival in order to obtain a false sense of value and worth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>It becomes a problem when your identity is on the line a war trying to tear down someone&rsquo;s identity</strong> it&rsquo;s not me trying to best you to show you you&rsquo;re fake and I&rsquo;m real it&rsquo;s not me trying to best you to show you that I&rsquo;m superior to you and that is the ultimate problem with finding our worth in what we do. <strong>What we tend to do is find the quality of our work as the quality of our worth and I think that&rsquo;s a lot of what we&rsquo;re seeing between these guys which I think is so unhealthy because at the end of the day you&rsquo;re in order to be great you&rsquo;ve got to have someone less than you—that you got to have someone to step on in order for you to have value and worth</strong>. If we&rsquo;re talking about the quality of our work—if your identity is shaped by what you do and being the best at it, then you got to step on someone else to prove that you are worthy of whatever it is you say you are.<br>
 <br>
So, at the end of the day, <strong>I think the real battle is between whenever you make anything like your ability or your body or your looks a part of your identity, they’ll ultimately begin to crush you. Those things are going to crush you because they&rsquo;ve got to always measure up. When they don&rsquo;t measure up, now your identity and your value are worthless.</strong><br>
 <br>
So I wouldn’t be surprised if internally Drake is feeling a sense of worthlessness … I wouldn’t be surprised if he has to go look at the things he&rsquo;s done to remind himself of his worth.<br>
 <br>
I remember when I was in high school, and <strong>in high school, my value was being the dope rapper</strong>. … And here comes Steve from Brooklyn. He&rsquo;s kicking metaphors and similes and bars and references. I was just destroyed. And because of that, <strong>my value was now in question. My identity, my worth, was in question</strong>.<br>
 <br>
So what did I do? I had two choices: I could either run away from him so that I could maintain some semblance of value, or I could associate with him so I could regain some sense of value.<br>
 <br>
Now, the good news is, I became a better rapper. The bad news is that <strong>all it did was reignite a false sense of self-worth and identity</strong>, to where, fast forward, I’m writing a song about identity because <strong>I’m still wrestling with that reality</strong>.<br>
 <br>
And <strong>God already told me I mattered. He told me in scripture. I mean, the creator of creation Himself knows me by name, and I’m still fighting. I’m still fighting for a false sense of identity.</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>Lecrae continues to explain how &ldquo;clout-cashing culture vultures&rdquo; need attention from other people in order to prove their own worth and have a sense of identity.<br>
 </li>
<li>Lecrae concludes that people who are themselves so consumed with the need to prove their worth and get attention would naturally assume that other people around them are also trying to do the same thing. Such people might jealously assume that Lecrase is “clout-chasing” and trying to make himself look more important by using Kendrick&rsquo;s mention of Lecrae in “Watch the Party Die” as an excuse to verse that associates himself with Kendrick.</li>

<li>Lecras seems to be empathizing with Kendrick as Lecrae recognizes how difficult it must be for Kendrick to be at the top of the rap game.<br>
 </li>
<li>Recall that on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick said “The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried”.<br>
 </li>
<li>While Kendrick did wonder what Lecrae would do if Lecrae was in Kendrick&rsquo;s position, Lecrae recognizes that his own trials, while certainly challenging, really don’t compare to what Kendrick must face as arguably the most visible hip hop artist in the world. Hence, Lecrae seems to humbly recognize that he really cannot know for sure what he would actually do since he can&rsquo;t even imagine being in such a position.</li>

      <h4 id="before-i-got-on-my-mission-i-was-a-party-victim--mission">&ldquo;Before I got on my mission, I was a party victim&rdquo; &gt; Mission<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#before-i-got-on-my-mission-i-was-a-party-victim--mission">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The word “mission” in the most general sense can be defined as ”a set of tasks that fulfills a purpose”. The word also tends to imply that the person will need to leave their home and go to a different land, nation or people group in order to fulfill their purpose (e.g. a diplomatic mission or spy mission).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within this history of Western culture, the word “mission” has most often been used to refer to efforts made by a church or an individual Christian who goes to a foreign country in order to introduce Jesus’s life and teachings to people from that country using language and references that the people can understand within their own cultural context.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As rappers who became Christians later in their teenage years of early 20s, Lecrae and Kendrick both came to the conclusion that God had sent them on a mission to introduce Jesus’s life and teachings to members of the Black community in America using language and references that Black Americans could understand within their own cultural context.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a Christian hip hop artist, Lecrase has been very clear and overt about his mission throughout all of his albums. In contrast, Kendrick has not usually been so overt. Most of his albums do have an overarching storyline that communicates central Christian understanding about Jesus and living a Christian life. However, listeners usually have to pay more attention to notice these overarching messages.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, on the 2009 track &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; from Kendrick&rsquo;s first project released under the stage name Kendrick Lamar, Kendrick openly discussed the moment when he talked to God and accepted his mission.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service<br>
Embarrassed so I start <strong>questioning God, &ldquo;What is my purpose?&rdquo;<br>
He said to live the way he did, that&rsquo;s all he want from me<br>
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday<br>
I said alright</strong>, enthused that my Lord gave a listen<br>
<strong>I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian</strong><br>
And this from a person that never believed in religion<br>
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can&rsquo;t help but give in<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m giving testimonies to strangers I never met<br>
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae builds off the “party” metaphor by saying that he was a &ldquo;party victim&rdquo;. At the most basic level, Lecrae seems to be reflecting on how his life prior to becoming a Christian was undisciplined in his pursuit of temporary pleasure in a way that led him to seek enjoyment in ways that ultimately led to pain and hurt.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, we should recall that in the analysis of the first verse of “Watch the Party Die&quot;, “the party” could also be interpreted as a reference to acts of sexual abuse particularly abuse of underage girls and boys.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is thus notable that on the track “Good, Bad, Ugly”, Lecrae discussed the trauma he experienced after being a victim of sexual abuse by a baby sitter who performed a sex act on him when he seven years old.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Folks workin&rsquo; late I had a baby sitter</strong><br>
I ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;bout to sit here and name her<br>
<strong>I was almost 8 when she came in late<br>
Woke me up with a game to play<br>
Did a few things that&rsquo;s hard to say<br>
And told me to keep that secret safe</strong><br>
Now how a young boy supposed to deal<br>
I&rsquo;m tryna act like it ain&rsquo;t real<br>
<strong>Had my innocence just stripped from me<br>
And I still don&rsquo;t know how to feel</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae&rsquo;s traumatic experience seems to align with Kendrick&rsquo;s own assessment that &ldquo;ever other rapper&rdquo; he knows has been sexually abused and continues to go unaddresed in many Black families which leads many Black people to live as &ldquo;victims&rdquo; as Kendrick discussed on the track &ldquo;Mother I Sober&rdquo; from *Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Family ties, <strong>they accused my cousin, &ldquo;Did he touch you, Kendrick?&rdquo;<br>
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Did he touch you?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No&rdquo; again, still they didn&rsquo;t believe me</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I asked my momma why she didn&rsquo;t believe me when I told her &ldquo;No&rdquo;<br>
I never knew she was violated in Chicago</strong>, I&rsquo;m sympathetic<br>
<strong>Told me that she feared it happened to me</strong>, for my protection<br>
Though it never happened, she wouldn&rsquo;t agree<br>
<strong>Now I&rsquo;m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced</strong><br>
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m nervous<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>A conversation not bein&rsquo; addressed in Black families<br>
The devastation, hauntin&rsquo; generations and humanity<br>
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters<br>
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other<br>
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain&rsquo;t recovered<br>
Still livin&rsquo; as victims in the public eyes</strong> who pledge allegiance<br>
<strong>Every other brother has been compromised<br>
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused</strong><br>
I see &rsquo;em daily buryin&rsquo; they pain in chains and tattoos<br>
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move<br>
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school<br>
His anger grows deep in misogyny<br>
<strong>This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After telling us that he was a “party victim”, Lecrae then says that he “brought the party favors”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Party favors&rdquo; are gifts that a party host gives to the party attendees to thank them for coming. This transition seems to suggest that Lecrae went from someone who was forced to be an unwilling participant of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; to someone who not only attended and willingly participated but seemingly organized and hosted&quot; the party&quot;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the most basic level, Lecrae seems to be saying that as someone who became successful in the entertainment industry, he was at the center of groups of people who were also undisciplined in their pursuit of temporary pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, if we take into account Lecrae’s history of being sexually abused, one could also interpret the line to be a reflection of how Lecrae’s trauma from sexual abuse led him to later to engage in sexual behavior that—while maybe not criminal—was not healthy or loving for himself or for those with whome he was sexually involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fittingly, on the same verse of “Good, Bad, Ugly” where Lecrae revealed that he had been sexually abused, Lecrae talked about the connection between his early sexual trauma of and the sexual misbehavior that he engaged in later in life. This sexual misbehavior continued until Lecrae forgave his abuser, received forgiveness and got on his mission.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>And <strong>I wonder how to address it</strong><br>
Can&rsquo;t tell my family too messy<br>
<strong>So I just embrace it it&rsquo;s hard to face it</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m too ashamed to confess it<br>
So I kept it in and ain&rsquo;t speak<br>
Didn&rsquo;t think it hit me so deep<br>
<strong>So into it I got promiscuous</strong><br>
And <strong>only God could help me get free</strong><br>
But I been forgiven<br>
My Savior risen<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m out the prison</strong><br>
I know that (I know that)<br>
<strong>I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles<br>
God will control that</strong> (yeah)<br>
Every time we slip and we fall<br>
Gotta get back up and fight on<br>
<strong>We are not defined by our past<br>
The future look bright<br>
I see the light on</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on “Mother I Sober”, Kendrick also wrestled with his own sexual misbehavior and addiction which he saw as one of the effects of the unresolved generation trauma from sexual abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Intoxicated, there&rsquo;s a lustful nature that I failed to mention<br>
Insecurities that I project, sleepin&rsquo; with other women</strong><br>
Whitney&rsquo;s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen<br>
Askin&rsquo; God, <strong>&ldquo;Where did I lose myself?</strong> And can it be forgiven?&rdquo;<br>
Broke me down, <strong>she looked me in my eyes, &ldquo;Is there an addiction?&rdquo;<br>
I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but this time I lied, I knew that I can&rsquo;t fix it</strong><br>
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me<br>
Gave me a number, said <strong>she recommended some therapy<br>
I asked my momma why she didn&rsquo;t believe me when I told her &ldquo;No&rdquo;<br>
I never knew she was violated in Chicago</strong>, I&rsquo;m sympathetic<br>
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection<br>
Though it never happened, she wouldn&rsquo;t agree<br>

<li>
<p>After acknowledging that he was a “party victim” who later “brought the party favor”, Lecrae goes on to explain that he had money to buy the party favors after he used his own trauma—including the trauma of growing up without a father and being a “party victim”—as a justification for having an unhealthy focus on wealth.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here “commas” refers to a large amount of money that needs a comma to separate the hundreds digit from thousands digit and the ten thousands digit from the millions digit.<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae describes the large amounts of money as the “devil’s wages”. The use of the word &ldquo;devil&rdquo; connects to the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick rapped.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s time to <strong>get these devils out the way</strong>, heavy metals on my sword<br>
We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s also notable that in St. Paul’s letter to the Church in Rome, St. Paul says &ldquo;The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The idea that the wages of the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;] are closely associated with death also connects to the titles of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “went over their head” refers to a situation in which a speaker says something that the listener does not understand, usually because what the speaker said was too complex or because the listener is not refined or thoughtful enough to understand.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the surface it seems that Lecrae is saying that many of his listeners will probably not understand all the terminology or references in the previous lines.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, Lecrae is also recycling lines from “Always Knew”, the opening track to Lecrae’s 2017 album, <em>All Things Work Together</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I know <strong>this might go over some heads</strong><br>
But I come from being <em>government fed</em></em><br>
Could be <strong>running from feds</strong><br>
But now I <strong>give the government bread</strong><br>
&lsquo;Cause you playin&rsquo; back <strong>the words that I said</strong>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here on “Die for the Party”, Lecrae essentially flips those lines to from “Always Knew” by using many of the same words but slightly tweaking their presentation or meaning.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>On both “Die for the Party” and “Always Knew”, being “government fed”, refers to a state of poverty in which the parents of a family do not make enough money to feed the family and thus rely on the government to provide a significant amount of the family’s food.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the United States, food was may be provided in the form of monetary assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (aka food stamps) or direct distribution of food items though the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which provides things like canned meat, canned vegetables, rice pasta, and cheese that has commonly been referred to as “government cheese”.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the phrase “bred for doing time in the feds”, bred is the past tense of “breed” referring to the way that genetics and environment or experience influences reproduction and the traits of subsequent generations.<br>
 </li>
<li>“Bred” is also used as a double entendre to refer to the homophone food item “bread” (i.e. a loaf of bread) which is something that Lecrae’s family or other families in poverty may purchased with SNAP benefits when they were &ldquo;government fed&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>Moreover, we find a triple entendre when we recognize that the food item “bread” is also used as slang for money, as it used in “Always Knew” where Lecrae talks about giving “the government bread” in reference to paying taxes on the money that he has earned as a grammy0winning Christian hip hop artist.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, prior to being a grammy winning Christian hip hop artist, Lecrae was “bred” (i.e. born and raised) in an environment where men and women would often try to get “bread” (both money and food) by committing federal crimes such as selling drugs, gang-banging, robberies, or scamming.<br>
 </li>
<li>In hip hop terminology, the word “federal” is often shortened to “fed” or “feds” which makes it a homophone for the word “fed” (i.e. the past tense of “feed”). On “Always Knew” Lecrae used the terms “government fed” and “running from the feds” as double entendre to refer peoplw who rely on food benefits from the federal government while simultaneously trying to evade arrest from federal agents after committing a federal crime.<br>
 </li>
<li>Here in “Die for the Party”, Lecrae says that he was bred (i.e. born and raised) to do “time in the fed” which refers to time spent in a federal penitentiary or prison after being convicted and sentences for a federal crime.<br>
 </li>
<li>The point here seems to be that based on the long history of slavery, sexual abuse, segregation, lack of education, racial inequality, poverty and other forms of generation trauma, the genetics and the environment that Lecrae received from his parents made Lecrae statistically more likely to commit federal crimes and be sentenced to time in the federal prison as punishment for his crimes.</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus bled</summary>
    
      <h4 id="bred-for-doin-time-in-the-feds-but-jesus-bled--jesus-bled">&ldquo;Bred for doin&rsquo; time in the feds, but Jesus bled&rdquo; &gt; Jesus bled<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bred-for-doin-time-in-the-feds-but-jesus-bled--jesus-bled">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After describing himself as being &ldquo;bred for doin&rsquo; time in the feds&rdquo;, Lecrae then says “Jesus bled”. Here &ldquo;Jesus bled&rdquo; is a reference to the scene in all four Gospel accounts in which Jesus’s blood spilled out of his body when Roman soldiers whipped Jesus, forced a crown of thorns onto Jesu&rsquo;s head, and hammered nails through Jesus&rsquo;s hands and feet to attach him to the wooden beams of an execution cross.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Lecrae uses the word “but” between “bred for doin time in the feds” and “Jesus bled”, which seems to imply a contrast. In particular, the punishment of a federal prison sentence that guilty people receive for committing federal crimes is contrasted with the punishment of beatings, whipping, torture, and crucifixion that an innocent Jesus received for a crime that he did not commit. Moreover, all four Gospel accounts make it clear that as the only truly innocent man, Jesus died on behalf of and in place of those who were actually guilty.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of an innocent Jesus being executed in place of the guilty is most clearly highlighted in a scene in which the Judeans who were jealous of Jesus asked the Roman governor to free a criminal who was convicted of murderer and leading of an armed revolt and to crucify Jesus in place of this criminal.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now at the Passover feast <strong>the Roman governor was accustomed to release to the crown one prisoner whom they desired. At the time, they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas (one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder)</strong>. When therefore they were gathered together, <strong>Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”</strong><br>
 <br>
Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. But the Roman governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”<br>
 <br>
<strong>They said, “Barabbas!”</strong><br>
 <br>
Pilate, <strong>the Roman governor, said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?”</strong><br>
 <br>
<strong>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”</strong><br>
 <br>
But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?<br>
 <br>
But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”<br>
 <br>
So when Pilate, the Roman governor, saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crown, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”<br>
 <br>
<strong>All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!”<br>
 <br>
Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he whipped and delivered to be crucified.</strong></em><br>
 <br>
-Matthew 27:15-26</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, as we already pointed out, the word “bred” (i.e. past tense of “breed”) is a homophone with the food item “bread” and also rhymes with “bled”. In another famous scene that is often referred to as the “Last Supper” or “Lord’s Supper”, Jesus shares broken pieces of bread and a cup of wine with his disciples and declares that the broken bread is actually Jesus’s body which is broken during Jesus’s crucifixion and the wine is actually Jesus’s blood which is shed during Jesus’s crucifixion. By giving his disciples his body and blood to eat and drink, Jesus promises to use this meal to help the disciples find freedom from their sins and transform the disciple to be more like Jesus.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>As they were eating, <strong>Jesus took bread, gave thanks (Greek: eucharisteō) for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”<br>
 <br>
He took the cup of wine, gave thanks (Greek: eucharisteō), and gave to them, saying, “All of you drink it, for this is my blood of the new agreement, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness and freedom from sins.</strong></em>
 <br>
-Matthew 26:26-28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This “Last Supper” or “Lord’s Supper” was later instituted as a Christian ritual called “communion” referring to the idea of the church community forming a union with God. The ritual is alternatively known as the “eucharist” referring to the Greek word for “give thanks”. For most of church history, communion / the eucharist has been the central component of church services and of Christian life as a whole.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, we now recognize that the word “bred” is actually a quadruple entendre which refers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Bred” as in breeding offspring</li>
<li>“Bread” as in a loaf of bread</li>
<li>“Bread” as in money</li>
<li>“Bread” as in Jesus’s body</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This quadruple entendre probably went over almost everyone’s head</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“Put a dent in their head” is a slang phrase that is normally said by someone who is annoyed or angry with another person and wants to threaten that they will violently hurt that person by striking the person on the head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This phrase &ldquo;puttin&rsquo; dents in they head&rdquo; mirrors the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick said “I want his head cracked before he&rsquo;s back home”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Lecrae points out, unlike Kendrick and others who might want to put a dent in the heads of their enemies, Jesus turned his head. Here the phrase “turned his” is a reference to Jesus’s teaching that instead of using violence to oppose and hurt an evil person in the same way that the evil person hurt one of Jesus’s disciple, it would be better for the disciple to “turn the other cheek” when they are slapped in the face or otherwise insulted.</p>
<ul>
<li>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I say to you, <strong>do not show opposition in the same way as an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek toward him also</strong>.<br>
-Matthew 5:38-39</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus exemplified his own teaching after he was arrested and one of the officers slapped Jesus on the face.
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Judeans always meet. I said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, they know the things which I said.”
 <br>
When Jesus had said this, <strong>one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus</strong>, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?”
 <br>
<strong>Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, confirm the wrong; but if I spoke rightly, why do you beat me?”</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>It is notable that when Jesus was slapped in the face he did speak against the wrong that was being done to him but he did not add another wrong to the situation but using his power to slap the officer in response.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “my cup runneth over” is a reference to a poem called Psalm 23 in which King David reflects on how the Lord takes care of him, provides what he needs, and keeps him safe from danger even in the “presence of his enemies.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.</strong>
You anoint my head with oil.
<strong>My cup runs over</strong>.
Surely goodness and loyal love will follow me all the days of my life,
and <strong>I will live</strong> in the house of the LORD <strong>forever</strong>.</em>
-Psalm 23:4-6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Psalm 23, King David expresses a deep trust in God’s protection which allows him to sit at a table and drink wine from a cup even while his enemies are around him. This trust in God’s protection leads David to a peaceful disposition which is a clear contrast with Kendrick who seems convinced the he must deal with his enemies himself throughout “Watch the Party Die” and throughout the battle with Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Lecrae says his cup “runs over with nonsense” puts an interesting twist on Psalm 23. This twist seems to suggest a very different dynamic where he does not have the sense to trust the Lord in the presence of his enemies.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of sense might be due to Lecrae being emotionally dysregulated, not being able to think clearly or making bad decisions after drinking alcohol. Lecrae has more recently quit drinking alcohol for his own health and well being, which is something that he has talked about openly in a few interviews and podcast episodes.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Lecrae already mentioned how he used his trauma to &ldquo;pay the wages&rdquo;, Lecrae could also be building on this idea of using alcohol as an unhealthy way to deal with personal pain.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“The hearts grow cold” seems to be a reference to Jesus’s prophecy about a pattern of destructive circumstances in which various individuals and false prophets will misrepresent Jesus and claim to be anointed leaders while leading many people away from Jesus. Leading people away from Jesus will eventually lead to wars, betrayal, sin, lawlessness, famine, environmental devastation and eventually to the end of the world as we know it. Within such a pattern of turning from Jesus’s commandments towards chaos, Jesus said that many humans “love will grow cold”.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray. For <strong>many will come</strong> in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ (anointed leader),’ and will <strong>lead many astray</strong>. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.<br>
 <br>
Then <strong>they will deliver you up to oppression and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations</strong> for my name’s sake. Then many will stumble, and will hand one another over to the authorities, and <strong>will hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray</strong>. Because actions against the law will be multiplied, <strong>the love of many will grow cold</strong>. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. This Good News (aka Gospel) of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and <strong>then the end will come</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 24:4-14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of human wickedness being a sign that the end is coming is similar to Kendrick&rsquo;s assessment of why it&rsquo;s time for the party to end.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“They love to do evil” is reminiscent of Jesus’s words to one of the Judean religious leaders where he explained that although God loved the world and had sent Jesus to be the “light of the world” who would rescue people from death and give them a new kind of eternal life, not all humans would receive this eternal life. Jesus said that some humans would be condemned to death not necessarily in a direct form of Jesus condemning them, but in the indirect form of the natural consequences for preferring to do evil in the darkness rather than coming into the light where they would need to stop doing evil.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his unique and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For <strong>God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be [saved / rescued] through him</strong>.<br>
 <br>
The one who believes in him is not condemned. <strong>The one who does not believe has already been condemned</strong>, because that one has not believed in the name of the unique and only Son of God.<br>
 <br>
<strong>This is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, but humans loved the darkness rather than the light; because their works were evil</strong>. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, unless his actions would be exposed. But the one who does what is true comes to the light, that his actions may be revealed, that they have been done in God.</em><br>

St. Paul says that some people will turn away from Jesus’s teaching and instead listen to the teaching of “deceitful spirits”, “demons”, “liars” and “hypocrites.” St. Paul suggests that these liars and hypocrites can be identified by the fact that they have burned a brand mark into their own conscience which shows that they are owned by the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].</p>

<ul>
<li>After talking about cold-hearted liars and hypocrites who love to do evil, Lecrae seems to give us an example of one such person: the drug dealer who sold fentanyl to Lecrae’s cousin<br>
 </li>
<li>Fentanyl is a powerful, unnatural, man-made opioid that was initially used in the 1990s to relieve pain for patrons with severe pain, such as cancer. However, in the 2000s fentanyl began to be used illegally as a recreational drug. The recreational form of fentanyl is often mixed with other hard drugs like heroin or cocaine—often without the user’s knowledge—which made it very likely to make users overdose even with small amounts of fentanyl.<br>
 </li>
<li>Fentanyl overdoses became an epidemic after illegal, irresponsible and greedy actions by some pharmaceutical companies and doctors led to a sharp increase in the number of opioid addictions throughout North America.<br>
 </li>
<li>Gangs in Mexico exploited this widespread increase in additions, importanting chemical precursors from China, producing fentanyl cheaply in Mexico and then smuggling fentanyl laced pills across the border into America.<br>
 </li>
<li>By the mid 2010s, many of these fentanyl laced pills ended up in the hands of teenagers who bought what they thought they were buying prescription pills such as oxycodone/percocets, xanax, adderall, or vicodin but ended up ingesting lethal doses of fentanyl.<br>
 </li>
<li>In many cases, teenagers bought these fentanyl laced pills through social media apps, particularly snapchat which offered the useful feature of disappearing messages.<br>
 </li>
<li>The details of the fentanyl epidemic highlight how a pursuit of person profit or national gross domestic profit by stock market investors, drug dealers, gangs, pharmaceutical corporations, tech companies and governments can inspire killers to adopt evil, wicked business practices which lead to increased addictions and deaths of countless men, women and children, including Lecrae’s cousin.</li>

<li>
<p>The wicked choices that allowed Lecrae’s cousin to take fentanyl leads Lecrae to say “I want the dealer’s head”. This statement seems to apply that somewhere inside his heart, Lecreae would like the dealer to be murdered, maybe even decapitated so the head can be brought back to Lecrae for inspection.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line directly mirror Kendrick’s line from the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If I&rsquo;m not his vote<br>
<strong>Then you need to bring his fuckin&rsquo; head, or film that shit in hi-res</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Lecrae has been a Chrisitan hip hop artists for almost two decades, it might be surprising to hear him express this desire to take revenge for his cousin through a vicious murder.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, this honest confession highlights the fact that even after “getting on his mission” Lecrae still faces spiritual, mental, and emotional tests which causes him to wrestle with faith and really decide if he wants to follow Jesus’s teachings and example. Lecrae’s honest wrestling is likely one of the main reasons that Kendrick wanted to know “what Lecrae would do”.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Having just highlighted gangs who profit by exploiting individuals who are addicted to opioids, Lecrae now compares those gangs to music labels who profit from exploiting listeners and rappers who are addicted to hip hop.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This comparison between selling addictive drugs and selling addictive music is a longstanding motif within hip hop lyrics.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New York based rap legend Nas largely introduced the motif a single line from the second verse of the track “Represent” from his classic debut album Illmatic released on April 19, 1994.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Somehow the <strong>rap game reminds me of the crack game</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exactly one week after the release of &ldquo;Represent&rdquo;, on April 26, 1994 the legendary Atlanta-based duo Outkast released their classic debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, whose first full track “Myintrotoletuknow” featured a verse from Andre who further developed the motif.</p>
<ul>
<li>See, <strong>that rap shit is really just like sellin&rsquo; smoke<br>
If you got some fire shit, your niggas gonna always toke<br>
Dope is not what I be slingin&rsquo; on this track</strong>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jay-Z then turned the motif into an extended metaphor on an entire song called “Rap Game / Crack Game” which was released on Jay-Z’s 1997 album, <em>In My Lifetime, Vol. 1</em>. Notably, the hook for “Rap Game / Crack Game” samples both “Represent” and “Myintrotoletuknow”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Won&rsquo;t stop niggas<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game&rdquo;</strong><br>
Jigga! Feel me!<br>
Pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya<br>
<strong>&ldquo;See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke&rdquo;</strong><br>
Uhh, Roc-A-Fella<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>We treat this rap shit just like, handlin&rsquo; weight<br>
What they want we give it to &rsquo;em, what they abandon we take<br>
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it&rsquo;s at stake<br>
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake<br>
When it&rsquo;s hot, get on my money spot in every state<br>
Like the Wiz and Camelot, the mom-and-pop&rsquo;s is the gate<br>
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area<br>
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit<br>
Gon&rsquo; need a middle man, so we look to radio<br>
Let &rsquo;em test the product, give &rsquo;em a promo show<br>
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe<br>
Then we drop a maxi single and charge &rsquo;em two for five<br>
Ain&rsquo;t tryin&rsquo; to, kill &rsquo;em at first just, buildin&rsquo; clientele<br>
So when the album drops the first weeks it&rsquo;s on sale<br>
But when demand grows it&rsquo;s time to expand yo<br>

<strong>I got that uncut raw to make a fiend&rsquo;s body jerk<br>
Got your whole block now, pumpin&rsquo; my work<br>
My CD&rsquo;s is like keys for you Willie&rsquo;s who<br>

And my singles like gems, you know the treys<br>
Get you high for a while, but the, high don&rsquo;t stay<br>
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks<br>
&lsquo;Cause when this shit flip, I&rsquo;ma get on some other shit<br>
Never pitchin&rsquo; for a label, Jigga&rsquo;s the hook-up<br>
You know my shit is fishscale, y&rsquo;all niggas is cook up<br>
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota<br>
They know my shit stretch without the bakin&rsquo; soda<br>
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key<br>
Priority&rsquo;s work wasn&rsquo;t right so I switched factories<br>
Now I&rsquo;m the new nigga, who figured I&rsquo;d get the game locked<br>
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drake even referenced &ldquo;Rap Game / Crack Game&rdquo; when he was rapping about a former girlfriend and acting like a &ldquo;street nigga&rdquo; on the 2013 track “Come Thru” on <em>Nothing Was the Same</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Someone put a order in for a chicken<br>
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen<br>
Yeah, <strong>they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up</strong><br>
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?<br>
<strong>Rap game, crack game, ain&rsquo;t that different, ya know?<br>
Last album had it boomin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; vicious, ya know?</strong><br>
And ya know I need ya back in my life</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of corporate guys from the entertainment industry using hip hop music like an addictive substance is also something that Kendrick alluded to on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick rapped</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s cynical to say I know these <strong>artists</strong> petrified<br>
The end result, in jail by Jezebel or <strong>drugged up full of lies</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much like Kendrick, Lecrae criticizes the music industry—particularly record labels—for exploiting youth who feel they can’t live without hip hop music. These labels obtain precursor materials from Black artists coming out of poor, urban areas, who then produce music that “parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth” and may ultimately lead young people to make choices that lead them directly to a federal prison cell or a casket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae also seems to acknowledge that we can’t fully blame hip hop addicts for their choices because addiction is a sickness. This acknowledgement leads Lecrae to tell the music labels, “I’m sick of y’all”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, Lecrae notes that his father was a member of the Compton Crips gang and his uncle was a member of the Pirus gang.  Although Lecrae never met his father, knowing that the men in his family chose to be affiliated with gangs still had a deep influence on Lecrae as he was growing up with a single mother in a poor, urban Black neighborhood.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Lecrae became a teenager he faced his own choice about whether to follow in the footsteps of his absent father or uncle and join the Crips or the Pirus— or whether he take a totally different path.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick specifically mentioned the Compton Crips and Pirus when he detailed Compton’s violent environment on  the track “m.A.A.d city” from Kendrick&rsquo;s classic debut album.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If <strong>Pirus and Crips</strong> all got along<br>
They&rsquo;d probably gun me down by the end of this song<br>
Seem like the whole city go against me<br>
Every time I&rsquo;m in the street, I hear—<br>
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!</em>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moverover, Lecrae by saying that he is &ldquo;stuck in the middle of this <em>madness</em>&rdquo; Lecrae might be making another subtly allusion to the “m.A.A.d. City” of Compton, California.</p>

<ul>
<li>For many Black boys growing up in poor, urban neighborhoods, their only choice seems to be between various gangs like the Crips and Pirus. Lecrae laments the fact that in a truly better world, he and these other young Black boys would have the opportunity to choose between Howard Unversity and Hampton University, which are two of America’s historically Black colleges and universities (aka HBCUs).</li>

<ul>
<li>In contrast to the dealer who sold his cousin fentanyl and the music labels who exploit rap music addicts, Lecrae shows love and empathy for the peers with whom he grew up, even though many of them eventually chose to gang bang, sell drugs, or profit from some other illegal and destructive activity.<br>
 </li>
<li>Despite this love and empathy, Lecrae also seems to be genuinely disturbed as he implores us to “look at the damage” that his peers ccaused throughout their choices to profit from various illegal activity.<br>
 </li>
<li>It’s also notable that the phrase “What’s the damage?” is a way to ask how much someone has to pay for something, particularly for expensive shopping purchases or a restaurant bill. Hence, these peers have been doing physical, emotional, spiritual and financial “damage” to themselves and others so that they can get enough money to pay for the “damage” when they indulge themselves at a store or restaurant.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae seems to be having a conversation with one of these former peers where he says, “You want me put you on but I know you still with the scammin&rsquo;”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phrase “put me on” is a slang way for someone to ask another person to use their position, connections, success or abundance to hook the speaker up, show the speaker undeserved favor, or help the spaker get something that the speaker wants.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, the request seems to be from a former peer who is asking Lecrae to use his wealth and status as a successful grammy winning hip hop artist to “put him on” with some kind of economic opportunity.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae indicates that he is reluctant and will probably refuse to put this former peer on because Lecrae knows that the peer is still involved with illegal activity, particularly scamming people to get money.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that Kendrick called out rappers and influencers who “glorify scamming” and threats to execute them by saying “you get chipped over this credit card”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we previously noted, Kendrick’s has mentioned the destructive behavior of scammers on several tracks throughout his career.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After empathizing with his peers who have profited from illegal activity while also refusing to further enable them, Kendrick calls out the “crooked doctor” who prescribed Xanax to Lecrae, which eventually Lecrae to become addicted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xanax is the brand name form of a prescription medication named alprazolam that produces a calming effect on a patient and thus is primarily used to treat anxiety disorders. However, that same calming effect makes it very easy for patients to become addicted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the medical system of the United States, there have been numerous examples of corrupt doctors who have overprescribed Xanax to patients when there was little to no medical justification for the patient to be taking Xanax who should not have been using Xanax.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These doctors were often incentivized to over prescribe Xanax because of:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>“Kickback” payments that doctors receive from pharmaceutical companies whenever they prescribe the medication.<br>
 </li>
<li>Submitting to the pressure of patients who demanded Xanax.
 </li>
<li>So called “pill mill” business models where patients can skip insurance coverage and pay cash directly to doctor to obtain Xanax without a justifiable medial reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases people who were prescribed Xanax without a justification ended up hospitalized or dead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant amount of the patient demand for Xanax and the subsequent opportunity for “pill mill” business practices for Xanax can be traced to media influencers and stars including hip hop artists who have released a countless number of songs which glorify taking Xanax, or Xans, similar to the trend of making songs about molly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These doctors who over prescribed Xanax along with the pharmaceutical corporations who profited from selling Xanax thus seem to illustrate Kendrick’s point from “Worldwide Steppers” that seemingly everyone is a killer or silent murderer, particularly when those are seeking profit</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers</strong><br>
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)<br>
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin&rsquo; philosophies<br>
You either gon&rsquo; be dead or in jail, killer psychology<br>
<strong>Silent murderer, what&rsquo;s your body count? Who your sponsorship?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 2017, Lecrae has been vocal about his own personal struggle and journey with anxiety which included a time when he was taking Xanax as prescribed by a doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the 2017 track “Worth It” Lecrae mentioned that stress had led him to be on Xans for a bit before getting off of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;ve been over-stressin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve been second guessin&rsquo;<br>
<strong>I was on them Xan&rsquo;s for a second</strong>, I was feelin&rsquo; so defeated</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the 2022 track “Deconstruction”, Lecrae went into more details about how his mental, emotional and spiritual struggle led him lose his faith in God and look to Xanax for peace of mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>*<strong>I ain&rsquo;t know if God was real no mo&rsquo;</strong><br>
Every day we gettin&rsquo; killed and <strong>I can&rsquo;t deal no mo&rsquo;</strong><br>
<strong>I started slipping in the darkness, I&rsquo;m feeling heartless<br>
Christians got me traumatized, I don&rsquo;t know who God is<br>
Drinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree</strong><br>
Maybe I should get divorced, I don&rsquo;t know why she married me<br>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the purpose? What&rsquo;s the point?<br>
Nothing matters, I&rsquo;m just matter, I&rsquo;m just atoms<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no Eve and ain&rsquo;t no Adam<br>
Where the Xannies? Let me at &rsquo;em<br>
I was floating in confusion until I dropped<br>
Woke up in a clinical depression</strong>, then it all stopped<br>
Sinnin&rsquo; like Saul &rsquo;til I hit Damascus<br>
<strong>God knocked me off the mule &lsquo;fore I hit the casket</strong><br>
Heard a faint voice calling me late, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep<br>
It said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Crae I know you love Me, I need you to feed My sheep&rdquo;<br>
Tears streaming as I weep, felt I heard the Lord speak<br>
I&rsquo;ve been running from You, but You never ran away from me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in 2024, Lecrae released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTbq5iyB_mI">podcast episode</a> where he talked at length about his journey with mental health including his diagnosis for ADHD, anxiety and depression along with his positive and negative experiences of take medications.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Having just called out a crooked doctors who have indirectly killed people by overprescribing Xanax, Lecrae shifts his focus to people who have been found guilty and sentenced to time in a prison cell after directly killing an innocent person.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line mirrors the first verse from “Watch the Party Die” where Kendrick rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>We even kill the killers &lsquo;cause they like taking innocent lives</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>At some level, Lecrae seems to feel genuinely surprised and disappointed to know that some of these killers feel no remorse about taking the life of someone innocent. However, at another level, he is probably not surprised at this lack of remorse based on the earlier lines such as &ldquo;They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae also attributes the killers&rsquo; lack of remorse to them displaying the “worst ignorance”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At one level, labeling these killers as “ignorant” in a pejorative sense could be seen as a insult or a justification for them to have an even harsher punishment. However, if you take the word “ignorance” at face value, Lecrae is really just pointing out that these killer are unfortunately lacking in knowledge, education or the ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one recognizes that these killer are really lacking in knowledge, education and the ability to comprehend consequence, it becomes possible to begin empathizing with them, particularly since they may never have been able to choose between Howard and Hampton.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After expressing his disdain for crooked doctors and killers who feel no remorse, Lecrae suddenly shifts the focus back to himself as he looks in the mirror.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of looking in the mirror to examine oneself—particularly to examine one’s own moral choices virtues and vices—is one of the most common recurring motifs throughout Kendricks albums.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot;, Kendrick talked about a girl who was scared of dealing with her emotions and lived behind a mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You live in a world, <strong>you livin&rsquo; behind the mirror</strong><br>
I know what you&rsquo;re scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Poetic Justice” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot;, talked to a girl that he was interested in and told here that authentic loved required an individual to look in the mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Love is not just a verb, it&rsquo;s you lookin&rsquo; in the mirror</strong><br>
Love is not just a verb, it&rsquo;s you lookin&rsquo; for it, maybe</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot;, Kendrick began to face his own mistakes that had led to the death of his friend as he rapped.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sometimes I look in the mirror</strong><br>
And ask myself am I really scared of passin&rsquo; away?<br>
If it&rsquo;s today, I hope I hear a<br>
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon<br>
With the Holy Ghost &rsquo;til it drown in the blood of Jesus<br>
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin&rsquo;<br>
The scent of a reaper, ensurin&rsquo; that my allegiance<br>
With the other side may come soon, and if I&rsquo;m doomed<br>
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons<br>
I suffer a lot<br>
And <strong>every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch</strong><br>
I tie my stomach in knots</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Real” from *good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot;, after accepting Jesus as his savior Kendrick was finally able to see himself clearly in the mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I do what I wanna do<br>
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I<br>
<strong>Look in the mirror and know I&rsquo;m there</strong><br>
With my hands in the air, I&rsquo;m proud to say yeah<br>
I&rsquo;m real, I&rsquo;m real, I&rsquo;m really, really, real</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “u” from <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, Kendrick considered committing suicide as he talked to himself in the mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Should&rsquo;ve killed yo&rsquo; ass long time ago<br>
You should&rsquo;ve felt that black revolver blast a long time ago<br>
And <strong>if these mirrors could talk it&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;You gotta go&rdquo;</strong><br>
And if I told your secrets the world&rsquo;ll know money can&rsquo;t stop<br>
a suicidal weakness</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “i” from <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, Kendrick declared that he loves himself after looking in a mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>As I look around me<br>
So many motherfuckers wanna down me<br>
But enemy gon’ never drown me<br>
<strong>In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me<br>
And I love my, I love myself</strong><br>
Huh, when you lookin&rsquo; at me, ah, tell me what do you see?<br>
I love myself,<br>
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli&rsquo;<br>
I love myself<br>
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don&rsquo;t seem shy<br>
I love myself<br>
One day at a time, huh</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “XXX.” from <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick detailed the murderous pattern of thoughts that characterize America before looking in the mirror and seeing that he is an reflection of America.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph<br>
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives<br>
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters<br>
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us<br>
It&rsquo;s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
Homicidal thoughts, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br>
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?<br>
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood<br>
Then bash him in, you Crippin&rsquo; or you married to Blood?<br>
I&rsquo;ll ask again, oops, accident<br>
It&rsquo;s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up<br>
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us<br>
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera<br>
<strong>America&rsquo;s reflections of me, that&rsquo;s what a mirror does</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire <em>DAMN.</em> also <a href="https://medium.com/@folutade/reflections-on-dissections-s5e20-finale-9e733f5e06e1">seems to be designed so that first half of the album mirrors the latter half of the album</a> to form a mirrored literary structure known as a “chiasm”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Rich Spirit” from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick seems to why a particular an keeps looking at the mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>More power to ya, love &rsquo;em from a distance<br>
<strong>Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Count Me Out” from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick was scared by what he saw in the mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wipe my ego, dodge my pride<br>
(And I&rsquo;m tripping and falling)<br>
<strong>Look myself in the mirror</strong><br>
Amityville, <strong>ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; scarier</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?<br>
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?<br>
<strong>3:30 in the mornin&rsquo;</strong>, scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)<br>
<strong>Ain&rsquo;t nobody but the mirror</strong> lookin&rsquo; for the fall off (Brrrt)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Mother I Sober”, Kendrick recalled looking in the mirror as a child recognizing that he was unique and gifted.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I remember <strong>lookin&rsquo; in the mirror knowin&rsquo; I was gifted</strong><br>
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Mirror”, Kedrick personifies “the culture” as a woman as Kendrick tells the personified culture to get a mirror and point it at him to see a reflection of freedom.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lsquo;Cause all of it&rsquo;s toxic<br>
Girl, I&rsquo;m not relevant to givin&rsquo; on profit<br>
Personal gain off my pain, it&rsquo;s nonsense<br>
Darlin&rsquo;, my demons is off the leash for a moshpit<br>
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me<br>
<strong>Workin&rsquo; on myself, the counselin&rsquo; is not easy<br>
Don&rsquo;t you point a finger just to point a finger</strong><br>
&lsquo;Cause critical thinkin&rsquo; is a deal-breaker<br>
Faith in one man is a ship sinking<br>
Do yourself a favor and <strong>get a mirror that mirror grievance<br>
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom</strong><br>
She told me that she need me the most, I didn&rsquo;t believe her<br>
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it<br>
Jokes and gaslightin&rsquo;<br>
Mad at me &lsquo;cause she didn&rsquo;t get my vote, she say I&rsquo;m triflin&rsquo;<br>
Disregardin&rsquo; the way that I cope with my own vices<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s time to break it off<br>
Run away from the culture to follow my heart</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still the most famous reference to someone looking in the mirror in a popular music song can be found in Michael Jackson’s hit single “Man in the Mirror”. On that track, Michael Jackson sang about his recognition that there were so many people in need while the systems of the world were not making the changes needed to address their needs. Michael Jackson came to the conclusion that any change would need to start with Michael looking in the mirror to see his own selfishness and start to make change in himself and in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m gonna make a change for once in my life</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s gonna feel real good<br>
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right<br>
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat<br>
This wind is blowin&rsquo; my mind<br>
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat<br>
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?<br>
A summer&rsquo;s disregard, a broken bottle top<br>
And a one man&rsquo;s soul<br>
They follow each other on the wind, ya know<br>
&lsquo;Cause they got nowhere to go<br>
That&rsquo;s why I want you to know<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m starting with the man in the mirror<br>
I&rsquo;m asking him to change his ways</strong><br>
And no message could have been any clearer<br>
<strong>If you wanna make the world a better place<br>
Take a look at yourself and then make a change</strong></em></li>

<li>
<p>As Lecrae looks in the mirror as he confesses himself to be a killer.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By expressing anger, sadness and criticism of those who unjustly kill others and the suddenly turning to acknowledge that he himself is a killer, Lecrae depicts himself as a hypocrite similar to Kendrick at the end of the track “Blacker the Berry” from *To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street<br>
When <strong>gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?<br>
Hypocrite!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the “ignorant” “killers sittin’ in they cell” who “don’t feel no remorse”, Lecrae clearly feels a great amount of remorse for being a killer. This remorse is emphasized by the phrase “blood on my hands” which is usually used to emphasize that a person is responsible for another person&rsquo;s death even if the responsible person did not directly kill them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">David, Bathsheba and Uriah</summary>
    
      <h4 id="the-blood-of-uriahs-on-my-hands-cause-im-that-killer-who-had-bathsheba--david-bathsheba-and-uriah">&ldquo;The blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer who had Bathsheba&rdquo; &gt; David, Bathsheba and Uriah<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-blood-of-uriahs-on-my-hands-cause-im-that-killer-who-had-bathsheba--david-bathsheba-and-uriah">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>In particular, by saying he is “that killer” with “the blood of Uriah” on his hand after having “Bathsheba in his quarters”, Lecrae is clearly depicting himself as someone who has perpetrated the same evil actions as King David.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the Bible, David is an iconic King of Israel who committed adultery with a woman named Bathsheba and then ordered Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah to be killed in order to cover up his adultery.<br>
 </li>
<li>As a young boy David was anointed with oil to mark him as the future of Israel. David subsequently displayed a remarkable amount of trust in God, which allowed him to rise up from a small shepherd boy to a boy who defeated a giant soldier named Goliath, and eventually was crowned King over all Israel.<br>
 </li>
<li>God blessed King David with tremendous military success due to many loyal soldiers including a man named Uriah who served David even though the man was not an Isralite.  Also,because polygamy was allowed at the time, David was able to marry seven wives who had already given birth to six sons.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, even after all of this success and all these women, King David was overcome with sexual desire when one night David went up to his roof and saw a woman naked while she was bathing in a house next to David’s palace. David used his servants to find out that this woman’s name was Bathsheba. They also found that she was the wife of Uriah, one of King David’s most loyal soldiers, who at the time was away from home for months as he was on the battlefield fighting for David’s army.<br>
 </li>
<li>Despite knowing that Bathseba was married to his neighbor and loyal soldier and despite already having seven wives with whom he could have sex as he pleased and the ability to marry additional women who were not yet married, David was overcome by lust and sexual desire. He then used his royal power to order servants to bring Bathsheba to his royal quarters where David then forced her to have sex with him.<br>
 </li>
<li>After some weeks went by, Bathsheba sent a message to King David telling him that she was pregnant. Moreover, since her husband Uriah, her husband was away at war for months, whenever Bathsheba began to be visibly pregnant, everyone would know that she had committed adultery even if they didn’t initially know with whom she had sex. She would thus face punishment, potentially even the death penalty, for adultery even though King David was the one who had forced her to have sex with him and under a strict observance of the laws of Moses should be punished by death.<br>
 </li>
<li>Wanting to continue his sexual relationship with Bathsheba, father an additional child, and avoid the shame and punishment of exposing his own adultery, King David concocted a scheme in which he sent a messenger to bring Uriah back from the battlefield to the palace. Once Uriah got to the palace, David told Uriah to go sleep at his house down the street, thinking that if Uriah went to his house he would have sex with his wife, Bathsheba. Then whenever Uriah and everyone else found out that Bathsheba was pregnant, they would assume Uriah had fathered the child from the night that he came home from the battlefield.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, David’s scheme did not work. Uriah was so loyal to King David and his fellow soldiers that he refused to sleep in his own bed or have sex with his wife while the rest of David’s soldiers were in rough conditions on the battle front. David even tried to get Uriah drunk thinking that this would cause Uriah to have self control over his sexual desire so that he would go home and have sex with Bathsheba. However, Uriah just ended up sleeping at the door of the palace.<br>
 </li>
<li>After David realized that Uriah was too loyal to go home and have sex with his wife, David decided that he had to kill Uriah immediately so that he could marry Bathsheba and make it look as if the baby was conceived after his marriage to Bathsheba.<br>
 </li>
<li>David then concocted a new scheme in which he wrote a letter to his army general which instructed the general to position Uriah at the most fierce part of the battle front. Then as the enemy attacked the general was to tell all the Israelite soldiers around Uriah to withdraw, leaving Uriah undefended so that he could be killed by enemy soldiers. To make his plan even more diabolical, David gave this letter to take to the general on his way back to the battlefield. Uriah again proved to be so loyal that he did not read the letter, though he was carrying his own execution order back to the general.<br>
 </li>
<li>After King David’s murderous scheme worked, David married Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba, who soon gave birth to David’s son without any human knowing that David had committed adultery and murder.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, God knew. God sent a prophet to confront and expose King David for his adultery and murder. King David knew that he was in the wrong, immediately confessed, and repented. Due to this repentance the prophet said that God had forgiven David and would not give David the death penalty.<br>
 </li>
<li>Desipte God forgiving David, the prophet said that the “Uriah’s blood was his hands” and as a natural consequence of David’s adultery and murder, death, bloodshed, and sexual abuse would haunt David’s family, begining with the death of the son that King David had fathered through the act of adultery.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has clearly reflected on the story of King David and how the lessons from King David&rsquo;s story might apply to Kendrick&rsquo;s own life. Most notably, just a few days before the release of Kendrick&rsquo;s major label debut album &ldquo;good kid, m.A.A.d city&rdquo;, Kendrick released the track &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3&rdquo; where Kendrick expressed how the pressure he faced as a rising hip hop star made him want pray and read &ldquo;the Book of David&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lsquo;Cause when the whole world see you as &lsquo;Pac reincarnated<br>
<strong>Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David<br>
And pray to God that you make it</strong> or live your life in The Matrix<br>
&lsquo;Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it&rsquo;s quite contagious</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3&rdquo;, Kendrick also mentioned the girl named Sherane who would go on to be a pivotal figure in the storyline of <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thinking &lsquo;bout when Sherane tried to set me up<br>
Cold game, full circle—they set up her.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter”, the first track on <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, tells the story of how a 17 year old Kendrick met a girl named Sherane at a house party. Kendrick was immediately overwhelmed by sexual desire for Sherane which caused him to ignore the potential danger that he could get into with Sherane’s male family members who had a history of gang banging. Kendrick thus proceeded to get Sherane&rsquo;s number, start a texting relationships and eventually drive to Sherane&rsquo;s house in hopes of having sex with her.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central<br>
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta<br>
Ass came with a hump</strong>, from the jump she was a camel<br>
<strong>I want to ride like Arabians</strong>, push an &lsquo;04 Mercedes-Benz<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Hello, my name is Kendrick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re handsome&rdquo;</strong><br>
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin&rsquo;<br>
Ciara had played in the background<br>
The parade music we made had us all wearin&rsquo; shades now, cool<br>
&ldquo;Where you stay?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Down the street from Dominguez High&rdquo;<br>
Okay, I know that&rsquo;s borderline Compton or Paramount<br>
&ldquo;Well, is it Compton?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied<br>
Then <strong>quickly start battin&rsquo; her eyes<br>
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me<br>
Seventeen with nothin&rsquo; but pussy stuck on my mental<br>
My motive was rather sinful, &ldquo;What you tryna get into?&rdquo;<br>
She didn&rsquo;t tell, just gave me her Nextel<br>
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer</strong>, and, well<br>
The summer had passed, and now I&rsquo;m likin&rsquo; her<br>
Conversation we havin&rsquo; probably enticin&rsquo; her<br>
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions&rsquo;ll end up wifin&rsquo; her<br>
<strong>Love or lust, regardless, we&rsquo;ll fuck &lsquo;cause the trife in us</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s deep-rooted, the music of bein&rsquo; young and dumb<br>
Is never muted, in fact, it&rsquo;s much louder where I&rsquo;m from<br>
We know a lot &lsquo;bout each other, her mother was a crack addict<br>
<strong>She live with her granny and her younger two brothers<br>
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible<br>
Family history of gangbangin&rsquo; did make me skeptical<br>
But not enough to stop me from gettin&rsquo; a nut</strong><br>
&ldquo;I wanna come over, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;<br>
That&rsquo;s what I told her soon as this episode<br>
Of Martin go off, I&rsquo;m tryna get off<br>
<strong>I was in heat like a cactus<br>
My tactics of bein&rsquo; thirsty probably could hurt me<br>
But fuck it, I got some heart<br>
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy</strong><br>
So now I&rsquo;m down Rosecrans in a Caravan<br>
Passin&rsquo; Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump<br>
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam<br>
At least I hope, &lsquo;cause my pockets broke as a promise, man<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that sex<br>
Thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout her thighs or maybe kissin&rsquo; on her neck<br>
or maybe what position&rsquo;s next<br>
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin&rsquo; up my texts</strong><br>
I looked at &rsquo;em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette<br>
<strong>Enthused by the touch of a woman, she&rsquo;s a masseuse<br>
And I&rsquo;m a professional pornstar when off the Goose</strong><br>
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when Kedrick pulled up to Sherane’s house he was questioned and then beaten up by two young Black men in black hoodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet<br>
And six steps from where she stay, <strong>she wavin&rsquo; me &lsquo;cross the street<br>
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see<br>
Two niggas, two black hoodies</strong>, I froze as my phone rang</em><br>
-“Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter”<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; ask you one more time, homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ask him if he over here for Sherane. Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?&rdquo;</strong><br>
 <br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who this nigga over here for, <strong>if he don&rsquo;t tell me where he from, it&rsquo;s a wrap, I&rsquo;m sorry</strong>&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, we gon&rsquo; do it like this, okay? I&rsquo;ma tell you where I&rsquo;m from, okay? You gon&rsquo; tell me where you from, okay? Or, or, or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<strong>&ldquo;Fuck all this talkin&rsquo;. As a matter fact, get out the van, homie. Get out the car &lsquo;fore I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie</strong></em><br>
-“Poetic Justice”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After getting beaten up Kendrick made it back to his homies. The homies then found out about Sherane had set Kendrick up to get stomped on, just like Kendrick mentioned on &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thinking &lsquo;bout when Sherane tried to set me up<br>
Cold game, full circle—they set up her.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The homies drove back to Sherane’s neighborhood looking to fire gunshots at the two guys in hoodies who beat Kendrick up. However, this plan for revenge went horribly wrong when the guys in hoodies shot back and killed Kendrick’s friend, Dave as heard during a skit at the end of &ldquo;Swimming Pools (Drank) - Extended Version&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&rdquo;<strong>They stomped the homie out over a bitch? K-Dot, you good, blood?</strong> Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off&quot;
 <br>
&ldquo;That nigga&rsquo;s straight, man, that nigga ain&rsquo;t trippin&rsquo;&rdquo;
 <br>
&ldquo;We gon&rsquo; do the same ol&rsquo; shit. <strong>I&rsquo;ma pop a few shots, they gon&rsquo; ru—they run opposite way, fall right in [BLEEP]&rsquo;s lap and he gon&rsquo; tear they ass up, simple as that&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there. We gon&rsquo; pop that bitch too&rdquo;
 <br>
&ldquo;Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;L[BLEEP], you good?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Yeah, blood, I&rsquo;m good – Dave, you good? Dave? Dave, say somethin&rsquo; – Dave? These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!&rdquo;</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right after that scene from the end of &ldquo;Swimming Pools (Drank) - Extended Version&rdquo;, the album transitions into the pivotal track, “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”. In the first verse of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”, Kendrick raps from the perspective of Dave&rsquo;s brother as Kendrick describes himself literally and metaphorically having “blood on his hands”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>And <strong>last night was just another distraction<br>
Or a reaction of what we consider madness</strong><br>
I know exactly what happened<br>
<strong>You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help<br>
Held him like a newborn baby</strong> and made him feel<br>
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up<br>
<strong>But the type of bullet that stuck<br>
Had went against his will, as blood spilled on your hands<br>
My plan&rsquo;s rather vindictive</strong><br>
Everybody&rsquo;s a victim in my eyes<br>
When I ride it&rsquo;s a murderous rhythm<br>
And outside became pitch black<br>
A demon glued to my back, whispering &ldquo;Get &rsquo;em!&rdquo;<br>
I got &rsquo;em and I ain&rsquo;t give a fuck<br>
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</em> thus tells the story of how Kendrick’s uncontrolled sexual desire led to the death of his loyal friend, Dave, which mirrors how King David’s uncontrolled sexual desire led to the death of his loyal soldier, Uriah.</p>

</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Lecrae, a girlfriend and an unborn child</summary>
    
      <h4 id="the-blood-of-uriahs-on-my-hands-cause-im-that-killer-who-had-bathsheba--lecrae-a-girlfriend-and-an-unborn-child">&ldquo;The blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer who had Bathsheba&rdquo; &gt; Lecrae, a girlfriend and an unborn child<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-blood-of-uriahs-on-my-hands-cause-im-that-killer-who-had-bathsheba--lecrae-a-girlfriend-and-an-unborn-child">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast to Kendrick, Lecrae has never given any indication that he was significantly involved with any shooting or gang activity that could have led to someone’s death. We may then wonder, why Lecrae claims that he has “blood on his hands”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Lecrae’s confession about being a killer is tied to a confession about having sex with someone who he shouldn’t have been having sex with, it is likely that Lecrae is alluding to an earlier period of his life when he impregnated a woman who later had an abortion.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The choices that led to the abortion happened after Lecrae had already become a Christian and in theory accepted the idea that he shouldn’t have sex outside of marriage. However, like King David, Lecrae’s old habits and desires drove him to remain sexually active with a girlfriend. Like Bathsheba, the girlfriend at some point told Lecrae that she was pregnant.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the influence of the Christian community that he was part of, Lecrae had theoretically accepted the idea that he should not advocate for an abortion in this particular situation. The girlfriend was also apparently open to the idea of keeping the pregnancy. However, Lecrae was unwilling to take on the responsibility of becoming a father while risking his opportunities and image, so he helped sway the girl towards the decision of having an abortion.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae recounts the true story of this abortion on the first verse of “Good, Bad, Ugly”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Remember back in &lsquo;02<br>
When I was in school and actin&rsquo; a fool<br>
My soul got saved</strong><br>
My debt had been paid<br>
<strong>But still I kept running off with my crew<br>
Sex on my brain and death in my veins<br>
Had a main thang we stayed up til 2</strong><br>
Smokin&rsquo;<br>
Waking and bakin&rsquo; <strong>we naked<br>
My body was lovin&rsquo; it<br>
Soul was hatin&rsquo; it<br>
Time and time after time<br>
Our bodies grew close the girl was so fine<br>
Heard a heart beat that wasn&rsquo;t hers or mine<br>
The miracle of life had started inside</strong><br>
My God<br>
Ignored the warning signs<br>
<strong>Supressed that truth I felt inside</strong><br>
I was just havin&rsquo; fun with this<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m too young for this<br>
I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; me myself and I<br>
Should I sacrifice this life<br>
To keep my vanity and live nice<br>
And she love and trust me so much<br>
That whatever I say she&rsquo;ll probably oblige<br>
But I was too selfish with my time<br>
Scared my dreams were not gone survive<br>
So I dropped her off at that clinic<br>
That day a part of us died</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Lecrae has held to the conviction that an unborn child with a heartbeat is a life, when Lecrae looks in the mirror, he sees himself as a killer who took the life of somebody innocent. Rather than taking the life of a loyal neighbor like Uriah, Lecrae likely feels even more guilty about taking the life of what would have been his first born child.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We never actually hear what Lecrae intended to say after “I’m that—”. It seems like Lecrae is censoring his own lyrics similar to how Kendrick censored his own lyrics on the third verse of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick menitoned Lecrae by name as he rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do</strong><br>
Fuck these niggas up or show &rsquo;em just what prayer do?<br>
I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1<br>
<strong>But I will—</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>With Kendrick lines from &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; we didn&rsquo;t arrive at much certainty about what exactly the uncensored line would have been. However, in the case of Lecrae’s censored line we do have some more potential clues. In particular, we can note that the bar before the censored line ends with Lecrae saying “I’m that killer” and the bar after the censored line ends with Lecrae saying “I’m that sinner”. If the censored line is following the pattern of those other two lines, we could expect that the censored part of the line should be a single two-syllable word which has a short “i” in the first syllable and an “er” sound ending the second consonant. Of all words that would fit these requirements the most likely choice would be the word “nigger”, which would mean that the uncensored line is “I’m that nigger”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censoring the word “nigger” would make a lot of sense for Lecrae since Lecrae releases music in the Christian hip hop sub-genre where explicit songs with profanity or racial epithets are not socially acceptable to most of the core audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “I’m that nigga” is a very popular catchphrase within mainstream hip hop culture and has been used in the lyrics of a countless rappers to depict themselves as strong, proud, hyper-masculine individuals who can get money by any means necessary, intimidate their enemies and have sex with the most attactive women wherever they go.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The popularity of the phrase “I’m that nigga” can likely be tracked back to the Soul singer Curtis Mayfield’s 1972 song “Pusherman” which plays during the opening scene of the 1972 black exploitation (aka blaxploitation) film Super Fly. Super Fly glorifies the life of a successful drug dealer who boasts of having lots of money and having sex with lots of women. Within the context of “Pusherman”, this drug dealer refers to himself by saying “I’m that nigga in the alley”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m your mama, I&rsquo;m your daddy<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m that nigga in the alley</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m your doctor when in need<br>
<strong>Want some coke? Have some weed</strong><br>
You know me, I&rsquo;m your friend<br>
Your main boy, thick and thin<br>

<strong>Super fly</strong>, here I stand<br>
<strong>Secret stash, heavy bread<br>

<strong>Silent life<br>

<strong>A victim of ghetto demands<br>

<strong>Makin&rsquo; love&rsquo;s how I swing</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By seemingly alluding to the censored phrase “I’m that nigger”, Lecrae seems to again be examining himself in the mirror and seeing that his past attitudes towards women, sex and success at the expense of others makes him no different than the drug-dealing protagonist of Super Fly or the dealer who sold Lecrae’s cousin fentanyl.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>While using prophanity or racial epithets is not socially acceptable to most of Christian hip hop&rsquo;s core audience, one particularly notable and early example of a Christian hip hop artist pushing back against audience excpectations can be found on Sho Baraka’s 2013 track “Chapter 9: Jim Crow” whose hook prominently features the word &ldquo;nigga&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I feel I&rsquo;m trapped in a crazy place<br>

<li>
<p>“Chapter 9: Jim Crow” delivers a stinging criticism of the legacy of Jim Crow segregation laws, White supremacy and the exploitation of Black people in America, though as expected, the track was very controversial within the Christian hip hop community.</p>

      <h4 id="who-let-eve-taste-the-fruit-of-death--adam-and-eve">&ldquo;who let Eve taste the fruit of death&rdquo; &gt; Adam and Eve<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-let-eve-taste-the-fruit-of-death--adam-and-eve">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following the censored word, Lecrae’s comparative self-examination goes back to the beginning of time as he seems to be saying.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I’m that nigger who let Eve taste the forbidden fruit</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Lecrae is comparing himself to Adam, the prototypical first man from the first narrative section in the first book of the Bible.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>In this first biblical narrative section, God creates humanity and places humanity in a paradise garden in a delightful area called “eden”. God provides humanity with an abundance of delicious fruit trees to eat.<br>
 </li>
<li>God splits humanity into a male and a female. The male was later referred to as “Adam” which means “human” while the female was referred to as “Eve” which means “life”.<br>
 </li>
<li>God tells Adam and Eve that they can live forever in the delightful garden if they follow God’s one commandment to not eat the fruit from one particular tree. However, if anyone eats the fruit from this particular tree that person will die. This “forbidden” tree was is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and represented the choice to redefine what actions should be considered good and bad without having to listen to God’s instructions.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, one day a spiritual figure speaks to Eve in the form of a snake and suggests that she should eat the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Initially, Eve restrains herself by recounting God’s instruction that she will die if she eats the fruit. However, the snake convinces Eve that God had not told her the truth and is holding her back from gaining great wisdom and becoming like God.<br>
 </li>
<li>Eve then eats the forbidden fruit and also gives some of the fruit to Adam who also eats the fruit despite knowing God’s instructions. Immediately, the two of them realize that they are naked and vulnerable to be taken advantage of by the other. Adam and Eve then make clothes to cover their vulnerability and shame.<br>
 </li>
<li>When God comes to confront Adam and Eve about the decision to eat the forbidden fruit, both of them try to shift blame to the other or to the snake or to God rather than taking responsibility for their own actions.<br>
 </li>
<li>God then forces Adam and Eve into exile outside the delightful paradise garden where they will eventually die without access to the life-giving fruit that God had actually permitted them to eat in the garden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to Adam, Lecrae knew God’s instructions which had forbidden him from having sex outside of lifelong commitment to his partner but due to his own desires and the snake-like influence of peers, music, movies, tv shows, and drugs Lecrae had disregarded God’s instructions thinking that he could decide for himself what sexual behavior should be considered good and bad. Lecrae&rsquo;s decision to disregard God’s instruction ultimately led to the death of his relationship with his girlfriend and the end of what would have been Lecrae’s first born child.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, now as Lecrae examines himself in the mirror, he takes responsibility for his own actions including his actions that led to the abortion. Lecrae even takes responsibility for some of they choices that his girlfriend might now regret as Lecrae says that he was the one who “let Eve taste the fruit of death.” When applied to Lecrae’s own situation with the abortion, Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that he failed in his responsibility of preventing his girlfriend from facing the tough decision to get an abortion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First and foremost, Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that played a significant role in getting his girlfriend to have sex with him. Moreover, as Lecrae mentioned in “Good, Bad, Ugly”, his girlfriend had such strong feelings for him that she probably would have kept the baby if Lecrae had been willing and supportive. However, from Lecrae’s perspective, his selfish focus on his own pleasure and success placed his girlfriend in a position where having an abortion seemed to be the wisest choice.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>And <strong>she love and trust me so much<br>
That whatever I say she&rsquo;ll probably oblige<br>
But I was too selfish</strong> with my time<br>
Scared my dreams were not gone survive<br>
<strong>So I dropped her off at that clinic<br>
That day a part of us died</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Sinner</summary>
    
      <h4 id="im-that-sinner--sinner">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that sinner&rdquo; &gt; Sinner<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#im-that-sinner--sinner">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By depicting himself as Adam, Lecrae is also depicting himself as the prototypical sinner.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical terminology, the word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOZ7ocLD74">“sin”</a> is used to refer to a failure to achieve a goal or reach a destination or follow directions.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Bible, Adam and Eve are presented as the first sinners because they failed to follow the direction that God had given them and thus failed to achieve their goal of continuing to live in the delightful garden.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While later biblical characters do not receive the same directions that God gave to Adam and Eve, the authors of the Bible conveyed the idea that God does provide directions that are meant to be followed by all humans. Most notably, the prophet Micah addresses a prototypical human using the Hebrew word “adam” and says that God requires humans to &ldquo;act with justice, show mercy to others, and be humble.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The LORD has shown you, O <strong>human (Hebrew: adam)</strong>, what is good.<br>
<strong>What does the LORD require of you</strong>, but <strong>to act with justice,<br>
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God</strong>?</em><br>
-Micah 6:8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the prophet Micah’s summary of God’s directions, humans sin when they act in a way that is unjust, unmerciful or pridefully unconcerned with others. Based on this criteria, Lecrae would likely see his past actions as truly sinful not necessarily because it broke some clearly stated rule about sex or abortions, but because he clearly acted in a way that focused on exalting his own pleasure and pride regardless of whether such actions led to outcomes that were unjust or unmerciful for his girlfriend or for his potential first born child.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Deserve death</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-deserve-death-along-with-these-liars-and-hypocrites--deserve-death">&ldquo;I deserve death along with these liars and hypocrites&rdquo; &gt; Deserve death<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-deserve-death-along-with-these-liars-and-hypocrites--deserve-death">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From a modern perspective, it sounds extreme and unreasonable for Lecrae to say that he deserves death for having sex outside of a committed relationship whether or not this led to an abortion. However, within the context of this verse these lines should be understood as part of Lecrae comparing himself to King David and Adam.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that when God sent the prophet Nathan to confront King David for murdering his neighbor after committing adultery with his neighbor’s wife, God acknowledged that David deserved to die for his unjust actions. However, because David repented, God forgave David and did not condemn David to death.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, going back to the beginning of the Bible, God told Adam that if he ate the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, he would die which is what eventually happened after Adam sinned by disobeying God’s commandment.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in the New Testament section of the Bible, in his letter to the Church in Rome, St. Paul reflects on how the sin of breaking God’s law leads to death for Adam who represents all of humanity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Therefore as <strong>sin entered into the world through one human, and death through sin; so death passed to all humans, because all sinned</strong>&hellip;<strong>death reigned from Adam</strong> until Moses, <strong>even over those whose sins were not like the violation of trust from Adam, who is a prototype</strong> of him who was to come</em><br>
-Romans 5:12-14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of sin as a failure to act with justice, love mercy and be humble which ultimately leads to the spread of death to all humans is an idea that Kendrick has explored, most notably in the intro to the track “PRIDE.”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Love&rsquo;s gonna get you killed<br>
But <strong>pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me<br>
And you and you and you and me<br>
And you and you and you and me<br>
And you and you and you and me and—</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Lecrae’s past action are part of the problem that leads to the cycle of sin and death, it follows that Lecrae is thus deserving of death.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae acknowledge that his past actions have shown him to be a liar and a hypocrite.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Lecrae is a liar, the natural conclusion is that he deserves to die along with the other targets of Kendrick&rsquo;s execution orders on &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I think it’s time to watch the party die</strong><br>
Street niggas and the corporate guys,<br>
<strong>the rappers that report the lies</strong><br>
I need they families mortified<br>
<strong>We can do life without &rsquo;em. Get they bodies organized.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that throughout the battle with Drake, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being a liar, as we discussed in the <a href="#street-niggas-and-the-corporate-guys-the-rappers-that-report-the-lies--rappers-that-report-the-lies">analysis</a> of the line &ldquo;the rappers that report the lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By acknowleding himself as a &ldquo;liar and hypocrite&rdquo;, Lecrae seems to be saying that he is no better than those who have &ldquo;burned their own conscience&rdquo; and negatively influence others as St. Paul discussed in his first letter to Timothy and Lecrae alluded to earlier when he said &ldquo;They hearts grow colder, they love to do evil, they burn they conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, under the influence of <strong>liars and hypocrites</strong> who have burned their own conscience as with a branding iron.</em><br>
-1 Timothy 4:1-2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; entered into the English language through its use in translations of the original Greek New Testament Gospel accounts. In Greek, the word &ldquo;hypokritēs&rdquo; originally referred to a stage actor who wears a mask and assumes a role in a play.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Gospel accounts, Jesus uses the word &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; as a pejorative criticism of his people&rsquo;s religious leaders who peformed religious practices such as prayer, fasting and charity primiarly so that they could be seen and honored by other people like an actor looking for applause from an audience. Hence, their religious practices was not rooted in actual love for God or love for other people. Instead, their religious practices were rooted in self-centered focus on their own status, power and fame.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae seems to recognize that he was clearly being a &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; or &ldquo;stage actor&rdquo; when he publicly claimed to be a Christian who follows God&rsquo;s instructions while privately disobeying God&rsquo;s instructions and leading his girlfriend to have an abortion to selfishly preserve his own dreams of becoming a famous rapper.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that in the first few lines of &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo;, Kendrick&rsquo;s first battle track that directly aimed at Drake, Kendrick referred to Drake as an &ldquo;actor&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Them super powers gettin&rsquo; neutralized, I can only watch in silence<br>
The <strong>famous actor</strong> we once knew is lookin&rsquo; paranoid and now is spiralin'</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, on the battle track &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo;, Kendrick implores Drake to take off the mask that he has been using to play his staged role as he repeated lied everything that was important.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Take that mask off</strong>, I wanna see what&rsquo;s under them achievements<br>
Why believe you? You never gave us nothin&rsquo; to believe in<br>
&lsquo;Cause <strong>you lied</strong> about religious views, you lied about your surgery<br>
<strong>You lied</strong> about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury<br>
<strong>You lied</strong> about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members<br>
They all pussy, <strong>you lied</strong> on &rsquo;em, I know they all got you in &rsquo;em<br>
<strong>You lied</strong> about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh<br>
<strong>You lied</strong> about them other kids that&rsquo;s out there hopin&rsquo; that you come<br>
<strong>You lied</strong> about the only artist that can offer you some help</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, back in 2015 when Drake and rapper Meek Mill released diss tracks that began over allegations that Drake had used ghostwriters, Kendrick also released the <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> track &ldquo;Black the Berry&rdquo;, where Kendrick acknowledge that he was actually the biggest hypocrite of the year when he spoke about bringing peace and unity within the Black community even though he was responsible for killing another young Black man.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m the biggest hypocrite of 2015</strong><br>
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean<br>

Or try to celebrate February like it&rsquo;s my B-Day<br>
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays<br>
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements<br>
Or watch BET &lsquo;cause urban support is important<br>
So <strong>why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street<br>
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?<br>
Hypocrite!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now with Kendrick&rsquo;s own battle against Drake in 2024, Kendrick seems to have lost the spiritual clarity that he had back in 2015 when he recognized that he might be the biggest hypocrite.</p>

<p>Lecrae calls out &ldquo;fake tough rappers&rdquo; who make up or &ldquo;fabricate&rdquo; the challenging situations or predicaments that they have gone through, likely in order to objain credibility from &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo;. Lecrae seems to point to such rappers as an example of the &ldquo;liars and hypocrites&rdquo; whom he is no better than.</p>

<li>
<p>These &ldquo;fake tough rappers&rdquo; who &ldquo;fabricate&rdquo; their &ldquo;predicaments&rdquo; seems be included among the &ldquo;steet niggas&rdquo; and &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; who Kendrick ordered to be executed in the first few lines of the second verse of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>In addition to the &ldquo;fake tough rappers&rdquo;, Lecrae also calls out &ldquo;fake deep gurus&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>In contemporary English, the word “guru” is often used to refer to an insightful and influential teacher who has made a career or commercial enterprise out of giving practical advice about how people should think and act in particular environments or roles. These include management gurus, marketing gurus, tech guru, entrepreneurship guru, health gurus, parenting gurus, lifestyle gurus or self-help gurus.<br>
 </li>
<li>At the same time, it&rsquo;s important to note that the word guru comes from Hinduism in India where it was originally used to refer to a respected spiritual teacher.<br>
 </li>
<li>While it is possible that Lecrae is criticizing a wide variety of commercialized gurus, the description of gurus who are “pushin’ voodoo” and “Tellin&rsquo; folks that my God ain&rsquo;t real” suggests that Lecrae is very specifically talking about “fake deep” spiritual gurus.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The term &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; refers to a set spiritual beliefs and practices that mix indigenous forms of West African spirituality with certain aspects of Roman Catholic Christianity. Voodoo develop after enslaved Africans were brought to the Haiti, Louisiana and other French-speaking areas of the Western Hemisphere.<br>
 </li>
<li>While voodoo encorporates aspects of Roman Catholic Christianity, most traditional branches of Christianity have consistently rejected voodoo as satanic or at the very least incompatible with a traditional understanding of Christian belief and practice.<br>
 </li>
<li>As a Christian rapper and one of the most influential Black voices among Millennial and Gen Z Chrisitans, Lecrae’s antagonism towards fake deep spiritual gurus is likely due to the fact that an increasing number of Millenials and Gen Z Americans are drifting far away from churches, Christianity, and “organized religion” while still retain a strong sense of personal spirituality.<br>
 </li>
<li>This outlook is often referred to as being “spiritual but not religious” and is seen as a way to pick and choose the spiritual practices that a person sees as most appealing or beneficial while being free to reject rules, structure, authority, or beliefs that do not align with a modern, liberal, secular perspective.<br>
 </li>
<li>Individuals who align themselves with the “spiritual but not religious” perspective often are attracted by various Eastern spiritual practices from Hinduism and Buddhism such as meditation, chanting, astrology, burning incense, crystal healing, herbal medicine and certain forms of yoga.<br>
 </li>
<li>These practices were popularized in America after the Counterculture movements of the 1960s which largely rejected existing Western values and beliefs associated with Christianity and paved the way for “New Age” spirituality which adopted the aforementioned Eastern spiritual practices from Hinduism and Buddhism and combined them with some reinterpretations of Christianity and a modern, liberal, secular perspective.<br>
 </li>
<li>The growth of the New Age movement in 1960s and 1970s America was aided by several spiritual gurus who came from India or other places in Asia and taught various practices and ways of thought to those who were interested in what would come to be known as New Age spirituality.<br>
 </li>
<li>In order to authenticity transmit ideas and perspectives from Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern spiritual tradition to people who are raised in a Western culture that was deeply influenced by Christianity, gurus often would often challenge or de-emphasize certain traditional Christian beliefs such as the idea that there is a single God who was should be worshiped.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that those who adopted New Age spirituality in the 1960s and 1970s were primarily White Americans. At that time, the vast majority of Black Americans identified as Christian with less than ten percent of Black Americans identifying as not religious, Muslim or some other non-Christian religion.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, as Millennial and Gen Z individuals became teenagers and adults in the beginning in 2000s a significant number of young Black Americans began to identify themselves as spiritual but not religious including many who were raised by parents who identified as Christian.<br>
 </li>
<li>Along with this increase in individuals who identified as spiritual but not religious, an increasing number of Black Americans began to adopt various Eastern spiritual practices and beliefs that had been popularized by the New Age movement and spiritual gurus in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>
 </li>
<li>Additionally, by the 2010s a growing number of African Americans began to incorporate various practices from indigenous African spiritual traditions, most notably practices from Ifa, a spiritual tradition from the Yoruba region in Nigeria, Benin and Togo.<br>
 </li>
<li>Due to the displacement of the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved Africans brought Ifa and other indigenous spiritual traditions to the Western Hemisphere where they were often mixed with certain aspects of Christianity to form new spiritual traditions such as Santeria in Cuba, Candomle in Brazil, Vodou in Haiti and Voodoo in Louisiana.<br>
 </li>
<li>All of these traditions include many core practices from Ifa and other indigenous spiritual traditions such as the worship of numerous deities (originally known as Orisha), sacrificial offerings, divination to communicate with deities or predict the future, ancestor veneration, and rituals to induce a worshiper to be possessed by spirits.<br>
 </li>
<li>The increased interest and adoption of Ifa inspired practices can be seen in many hip hop and R&amp;B projects released in the decade prior to the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>“High &amp; Holy” the final track on Killer Mike’s Grammy-winning 2023 album, <em>MICHAEL</em>, opens with Yoruba speaker praying to Ifa’s Orisha deities and the bones of ancestors.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Still the most visible examples of Ifa’s influence on African American popular culture can be seen in Beyoncé’s films for <em>Lemonade</em> and <em>Black Is King</em>.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On both Lemonade and Black Is King Beyoncé surrounds herself with water and wears a flowing yellow dress that seems to be a nod to traditional depictions of the Ifa sex, fertility and river deity, Oshun.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Black is King Beyoncé also wears outfits that seem to be inspired by other Ifa deities including, Obatala, Yemoja Oba and Oshumare.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One scene in Black Is King also shows Beyoncé looking through Robert Farris Thompson’s illustrated book Black Gods and King, which contains numerous pictures and descriptions of Yoruba artwork that often depicts Ifa deities,<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most direct acknowledgments of Ifa are found on “Black Parade” the song that plays during the film credits and at the end of the album. On “Black Parade”, Beyoncé makes numerous references to Ifa deities, attending Ifa ceremonies, praying to ancestors and adopting New Age practices.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In many cases, African Americans have distanced themselves from Christianity, embraced New Age or Voodoo spiritual practices, and in some cases tried to convince others that the God Christianity is not real because they see Christianity as a “White man’s religion” that is primarily associated with Western Europe, colonialism, slavery, segregation, and racism.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Western cultures tend to depict Jesus as a White European further emphasizes the perception that Christians worship “the White man’s god”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the line “tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real” Lecrae pushes back against these seemingly racially charged accusations against Chrisitanity by saying “my God” which emphasizes his deeply personal connection to God that is not based on White people, American identity or Western culture.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that over the course of the previous seven years, Lecrae had rapped about his journey and struggles with reconciling his Black identity with negative racial experiences among Christians that caused Lecrae to doubt whether God is real.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Come and Get Me”, Lecrae rapped about how prior to his rap career, his mother taught him not let the American education system fool him into thinking that God is a White man.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Twenty-four years old, <strong>my momma</strong> brought me to the globe<br>
Tried to tell me it was cold and taught me how to keep the coat<br>
Now, now, now <strong>she told me to go to school and get my education<br>
But remember there&rsquo;s a bias to them books that they be makin&rsquo;</strong><br>
Gave me, Soul on Ice and taught me<br>
&lsquo;Bout the Middle Passage, <strong>told me<br>
God ain&rsquo;t white</strong> and that there&rsquo;s<br>
More to life than rap</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, on the song “Deconstruction”, Lecrae raps about a period of his career in the 2010s when White Christians criticized and rejected him for speaking out about racial injustice and the killings of unarmed Black men. This criticism from White Christians pushed Lecrae towards the influence of several non-Christian Black thinkers who led him to doubt whether God was real.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I would speak at churches, hang with leaders</strong> and such<br>
You know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch<br>
I was so involved, never thought that I could fall, y&rsquo;all<br>
Right before the <strong>fall of 2015, I was all off<br>
It involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down<br>
Tweeted &lsquo;bout it, Christians call me clown</strong>, I was losing ground<br>
And Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times<br>
This time, when he spoke, <strong>it cut me deeper than I realized<br>
Doubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame<br>
&ldquo;Shame on you, &lsquo;Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus&rsquo; name&rdquo;<br>
Cut me deep, I was losing sleep, &ldquo;God, ain&rsquo;t these Your sheep?&rdquo;<br>
Why they hate me like they do?</strong> Maybe grace is really cheap<br>
<strong>Maybe this is all a lie</strong>, they don&rsquo;t really love me<br>
They just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public<br>
<strong>They&rsquo;re like following they God mean turnin&rsquo; on Black people<br>
Is Black evil? Why do they hate and attack people?<br>
I&rsquo;m vulnerable and cautious, I&rsquo;m reading Baldwin<br>
Ta-Nehisi got me thinking, now I&rsquo;m going all in<br>
I ain&rsquo;t know if God was real no mo&rsquo;<br>
Every day we gettin&rsquo; killed and I can&rsquo;t deal no mo&rsquo;<br>
I started slipping in the darkness, I&rsquo;m feeling heartless<br>
Christians got me traumatized, I don&rsquo;t know who God is</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, after a struggle with depression led him to the rock bottom, Lecrae eventually came to realize Americans living in Western society were often missing the context of the biblical Gospel accounts which might cause them to act in ways that do not reflect Jesus’s teaching and are contrary to God’s love. Lecreae discussed this breakthrough on “Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)” and “Deconstruction”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>And recently <strong>I found a peace to be<br>
Everything that I was meant to be<br>
This my identity</strong>, this what He give to me<br>
This what I&rsquo;m made to be<br>
My daddy still on that crack<br>
And he might never come back<br>
But I still love the man, I don&rsquo;t judge the man<br>
I could be on that track<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m glad that Jesus ain&rsquo;t American<br>
And that&rsquo;s the reason why I care again</strong><br>
People started praying for me<br>
And homies tellin&rsquo; me I was being arrogant<br>
I quit poppin&rsquo; them pills<br>
And <strong>even though we get killed<br>
I know that God got a greater plan<br>
For the death and blood that we spill<br>
So tell depression it can fly away<br>
Tell my doubts that they can die today</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ma catch me a wave, sail away<br>
<strong>Can&rsquo;t stop me now</strong></em><br>
-“Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)”<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Heard a faint voice calling me late</strong>, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep<br>
It said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Crae I know you love Me, I need you to feed My sheep&rdquo;<br>
Tears streaming as I weep, <strong>felt I heard the Lord speak</strong><br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve been running from You, but You never ran away from me<br>
It was people that hurt me, it wasn&rsquo;t God, though<br>
I let the church trauma turn into a God wound<br>
I learned the western world has twisted up the Scriptures, so when I re-enlisted<br>
I learned the eastern context the way that Jesus meant it</strong><br>
My peace has been cemented, my soul has been re-lifted<br>
<strong>My deconstruction ended, reconstruction is beginning</strong></em><br>
-“Deconstruction”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having personal gone through his own mental and spiritual crisis of faith, Lecrae now seems to now have a deeper, more personal connection with his God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae is also particularly critical of “fake deep gurus” whose shallow teachings could lead other Black Christians to unnecessarily through the kind of mental and spiritual crisis that Lecrae went through.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae goes so far as to say that the fake deep gurus who lead Black people away from God are participating in “real evil”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Lecrae’s perspective, if his God is the source of all that is good, it naturally follows that pushing people away from God is pushing them away from experiencing good and towards experiencing evil.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This pattern of leading God’s people to doubt God’s goodness and seek wisdom outside the bounds of a relationship with God is the same pattern that is depicted in the biblical Garden of Eden narrative where the snake convinces Adam and Eve to distrust God and acquire wisdom by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now the <strong>snake was more shrewd</strong> than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. He <strong>said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”</strong>.<br>
 <br>
The woman said to the snake, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”<br>
 <br>
The <strong>snake said to the woman, “You won’t really die, for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</strong><br>
 <br>
When the <strong>woman saw that the tree was good</strong> for food, and that it was a <strong>delight to the eyes</strong>, and that the tree was <strong>desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.</strong></em><br>
-Genesis 3:1-6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the New Testament, the snake is connected to the figure that is the primary source of evil who is known as the devil meaning “false accuser”, the satan meaning “adversary” or the “evil one”. This figure is described as someone who snatches away Jesus’s words about God’s rulership over humans and fights against the spiritual forces of good.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, <strong>the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 13:19<br>
 <br>
<em>For our <strong>struggle</strong> is not against flesh and blood, but against the elemental forces, against the powers, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and <strong>against the spiritual forces of evil</strong> in the heavenly places. Therefore put on the whole armor of God, <strong>that you may be able to withstand in the evil day</strong>, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace, above all, <strong>take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery arrows of the evil one</strong>. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</em><br>
-Ephesians 6:12-17<br>
 <br>
<em>There was war in the heavens. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war. They didn’t prevail. No place was found for them any more in heaven. <strong>The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.</strong> He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</em><br>
-Revelation 12:7-9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by saying “that’s real evil” Lecrae seems to be asserting that the “fake deep gurus” are doing the work of the evil one by trying to snatch away people’s belief in God’s word and using shrewd but deceptive argument to deconstruct Christian faith.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae refers to himself in the third person as he quotes from Kendrick’s line from “Watch the Party Die”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do<br>
Fuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?<br>
&hellip;<br>
A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae now seems to be posing the question to himself. Lecrae thus shows a notable amount of self awareness and humility by recognizing that none of us really know what we would do if we were placed in the exact same situation as another person. This is essentially the same point Lecrae made early when he reflected on Kendrick and said “I can’t imagine his position”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After looking in the mirror and confessing his own hypocrisy and injustice against the innocent, Lecrae seems keenly aware of the fact that he does not always act in a way that is consistent with his words, his beliefs or with Jesus’s teaching.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae’s humility and awareness of his human limitations leads him to simply hope that he would do what he thinks would the right thing to do namely to “seek the hand of God” and tell other people that Lecrae is himself incapable of always doing the right thing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>While Lecrae cannot be sure what he would actually do if he was placed in Kendrick&rsquo;s position, he hopes that he would &ldquo;seek the hand of God&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical literature, God’s “hand” symbolizes God’s ability to help, rescue and save his people from their enemies and any forces of evil who would try to enslave them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the Bible, this literary and symbolic reference to God’s hand is first used in a poetic song that the prophet Moses sang after God rescued the Israelite people out of slavery in Egypt, parted a sea for them to pass through to safety while drowning the Egyptian who were trying to re-enslave them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said,<br>
“I will <strong>sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously.<br>
He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.<br>
The LORD is my strength and song.<br>
He has become my salvation.</strong><br>
This is my God, and I will praise him;<br>
my father’s God, and I will exalt him.<br>
The LORD is a man of war.<br>
The LORD is his name.<br>
He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea.<br>
His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.<br>
The deeps cover them.<br>
They went down into the depths like a stone.<br>
<strong>Your right hand, the LORD, is glorious in power.<br>
Your right hand, the LORD, dashes the enemy in pieces.</strong><br>
In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you.<br>
You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.<br>
With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.<br>
The floods stood upright as a heap.<br>
The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.<br>
The enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder.<br>
My desire will be satisfied on them.<br>
I will draw my sword. My hand will destroy them.’<br>
You blew with your wind.<br>
The sea covered them.<br>
They sank like lead in the mighty waters.<br>
Who is like you, the LORD, among the gods?<br>
Who is like you, glorious in holiness,<br>
fearful in praises, doing wonders?<br>
<strong>You stretched out your right hand.<br>
The earth swallowed them.<br>
You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed.<br>
You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.</strong></em><br>
-Exodus 15:1-13</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story and poetry of God rescuing the Israelite people from slavery constantly emphasizes the fact that God’s people are meant to fully rely on God’s power rather than relying on their own power. In many cases, God&rsquo;s people are must learn to rely on God in situations where relying on their own power would require them to use their hands for violence against their human enemies.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of being humble enough to rely on the hand of God rather than using one’s own hands to commit acts of violence is further emphasized by Jesus and his disciples in the New Testament, most notably in chapter 4 of the letter from St. James.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members? You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war.</strong> You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? <strong>Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God</strong>. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, <strong>“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” Be subject therefore to God.</strong> Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. <strong>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</strong></em><br>
-James 4:1-10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick specifically refers to chapter 4 of St. James’s letter on the song “LUST.”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lately, in <strong>James 4:4 says<br>
&ldquo;Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord&rdquo;</strong></em></li>

<li>Lecrae continues to refer to himself in the third person as he seems to hope that if he was in Kendrick&rsquo;s position he would tell people that he is incapable of consistently making the right choice or living up to Jesus&rsquo;s example of sacrifical love.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae’s self-awareness and humility lead him to conclude that he does not possess moral integrity that would make him qualified to judge others.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the anger that Lecrae has justifiably expressed toward the drug dealers, music industry labels, crooked doctors, fake tough rappers and fake deep gurus, Lecrae is simultaneously aware that he would be a hypocrite to pass judgement and condemn these people without expecting to face judgment himself and be condemned for his own acts of injustice.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae’s reluctance to judge or condemn others is likely inspired by a passage from Jesus’s most influential set of teachings. In this passage Jesus warns people that they will be judged by the same standard by which they judge others. Jesus also spoke against hypocrites who point out the small wrongdoings of another person while they are blinded by their own much more significant wrongdoings.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged</strong>; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam of wood that is in your own eye?</strong> Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye? <strong>You hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.</strong></em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae continues to acknowledge his shortcomings by saying saying that even the good deeds that he has done have been so messed up by all of his evil deeds that his good deeds should be thrown out of consideration like a rug that had been stained by the discharge of blood and tissue during a woman’s menstrual period.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Lecrae is alluding to a passage from Isaiah 64 where the prophet acknowledges the numerous sinful deeds of God’s people and compares their righteous deeds to an unclean menstrual rag which women of that time used during their periods.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Behold, You were angry, for <strong>we sinned,<br>
We continued this way for a long time</strong>;<br>
How shall we be saved?<br>
For <strong>we have all become like one who is unclean,<br>
all our righteous deads are like a menstrual rag</strong>.<br>
We all wither like a leaf;<br>
our sins carry us away like the wind.</em><br>
-Isaiah 64:4-6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the spiritual tradition of the Israelites, menstrual blood and any other bodily discharge from men or women were also considered ritually unclean which meant that Israelites were not allowed to go near God’s temple until the discharge stopped.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implication here is that Lecrae’s good deeds have been so deeply affected by his evil deeds that based solely on his actions, he should not expect to be allowed to serve God or be on a mission as a Christian rapper.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite believing that he “deserves death” and believing that his good deeds are unacceptable due to his evil deeds, Lecrae also believes that he has rececived a new kind of life because of the unconditional love from God the Father and Jesus, the Son of God. Here Lecrae is likely inspired by Jesus&rsquo;s words in the Gospel according to St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, where Jesus states that God&rsquo;s love for the world motivated God to send Jesus into the world to give humans an opportunity to have &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For <strong>God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life</strong>. For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but <strong>that the world should be saved</strong> through him.</em><br>
-John 3:16-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having personally experienced the transformative power of Jesus’s love, Lecrae now offers Jesus’s love to those who suffered due to the evil deeds of others and also offers Jesus’s love to the enemies who have committed the evil deeds that caused people to suffer.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Lecrae seems to be following one of the commands in Jesus’s most famous set of teachings, which specifically instructed Jesus’s disciple to love their enemies because God the Father graciously loved those who did good deeds and those who did evil deeds.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You have heard that it was said, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rdquo; But I tell you, <strong>love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you</strong>, so that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust, the righteous and the unrighteous</em>.<br>
-Matthew 5:43-45</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, by offering Jesus’s love to those who have suffered from the evil deeds of others Lecrae seems to be aligned with New Testament writers such as St. Paul who were able to endure and even rejoice in the midst of suffering because of Jesus’s love.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>We also rejoice in our sufferings</strong>, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope; and hope doesn’t disappoint us, <strong>because God’s love has been poured into our hearts</strong> through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</em><br>
-Romans 5:3-5<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Who shall separate us from the love of [Christ / the anointed one]? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</strong><br>
 <br>
Even as it is written:<br>
“For your sake we are killed all day long.<br>
We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”<br>
 <br>
No, in all these things, <strong>we are more than overcomers through him who loved us</strong>. For <strong>I am convinced that neither death, nor life</strong>, nor angels, nor demons, nor elemental forces, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, <strong>nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</strong>.</em><br>
-Romans 8:35-39</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Even as Lecrae offers Jesus’s love to people who have suffered or are wondering what Lecrae would do to address all the evil in the world, Lecrae is very much aware that many people will feel disappointed and underwhelmed with Lecrae’s offer. These people may then respond to Lecrae by saying, “Really? That’s all you got for us?”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, Lecrae knows that these people will think that simply offering love is foolish because it likely won’t stop all the evil deeds that are causing people to suffer. Moreover, the idea of offering love to one’s enemies will seem absolutely foolish to most people</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be noted that unlike the modern usage of the word “love”, within the teachings of Jesus and his followers, “love” does not primarily refer to a set of positive feelings or attraction to a person based on that delightful aspect of that person. Love also doesn’t mean having a close relationship. Instead, love tends to refer to actions that one does so that another person can love a good life, which in many cases might involve actions that help another person to stop doing things that are evil and destructive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, the story of Jesus life, death and resurrection in the Gospel accounts of the New Testament is primarily a story about how Jesus loved his friends and enemies so much that he was willing to die for them to live a good life. This is a point made by St. Paul in his letter to the Church in Rome.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For while we were still helpless, at the right time <strong>Christ died for the ungodly</strong>. For one will hardly die for a righteous person; though perhaps for the good person someone would even dare to die. But <strong>God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us</strong>.</em><br>
-Romans 5:6-8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most notably, Jesus showed love for enemies when he showed empathy for the ignorance of the people who were crucifying him and asked God the Father to forgive them as he was hanging on the cross.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, <strong>they crucified Jesus</strong> there&hellip; <strong>Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing</strong>.”</em><br>
-Luke 23:33-34</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By saying “the cross is foolish to the perishing” Lecrae is quoting from a passage in St. Paul’s first letter to the Church in the Greek city of Corinth. In that passage St. Paul acknowledges that Jesus’s death on the cross must seem foolish from the perspective of non-Christians who made choices based on the supposed wisdom of Greek philosophy.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>For <strong>the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God</strong>. For it is written,<br>
 <br>
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.”<br>
 <br>
Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? <strong>Hasn’t God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</strong> For Judeans ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Judeans, and foolishness to Greeks, but to those who are called, both Judeans and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God; because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br>
 <br>
For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble; but <strong>God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong. God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that do not exist, that he might bring to nothing the things that exist, so that no fleshly creature should boast before God.</strong> Because of him, you are in <strong>Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God</strong>, and righteousness and holiness, and redemption: that, as it is written, “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</em><br>
-1 Corinthians 1:18-30</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae is acknowledging that most people who make choices based on the supposed wisdom of modern, secular philosophy will think that it was foolish for Jesus to love and forgive those who hung him on the cross, particularly if Jesus had the power and influence to have his followers fight and kill to prevent him from dying on the cross.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, St. Matthew’s Gospel account of Jesus being betrayed and arrested specifically highlights the fact that Jesus refused to have his disciples take up swords to fight against the betrayer or the opposing soldiers. Moreover, Jesus refrained from using his authority to call an army of angels to use supernatural force against his human adversaries. Jesus told his disciples that those who live by the sword will die by the sword.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then he came to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” <strong>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</strong>”</em><br>
-Matthew 26:45-53</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, by saying this is foolish specifically from the perspective of “the perishing” (aka those who are dying), Lecrae seems to be pointing out that Jesus dying on the cross seems foolish to mortal humans who do not truly believe in life after death and thus feel that it it necessary to protect their lives by any means necessary even if that means committing acts of violence against one’s enemies.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his first letter to the church in the Greek city of Corinth, St. Paul also asserts Jesus’s death on the cross along with Jesus&rsquo;s teachings on love and forgiveness would be worthless if Jesus did not actually resurrect from the dead or if Jesus’s followers would not actually be resurrected from the dead in the future.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But <strong>if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, your faith also is in vain</strong>. Moreover, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. For <strong>if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless</strong>; you are still in your sins. <strong>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have hoped in Christ only in this life, we are of all people most to be pitied</strong>.<br>
 <br>
<strong>If the dead are not raised, let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</strong></em><br>
-1 Corinthians 15:12-19, 32</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae thus seems to recognize that the love which Jesus showed in the cross will not make sense to people who do not believe the Gospel announcement of Jesus’s resurrection. Such people are more likely to agree with the approach of using violence to eliminate people who pose a threat to society just like Kendrick advocated throughout “Watch the Party Die”.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Because Lecrae hopes to offer Jesus’s love and refrain from using his strength to take violent actions against one’s enemies, Lecrae perceives that people in “the world” will call him “weak” and dismiss whatever he has to say.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “the world”, Lecrae seems to be alluding to a biblical concept in which “the world” refers to the prideful, contentious and unforgiving way that humans tend to live when they do not humble themselves by trusting in God’s goodness and provision. The use of this term is best illustrated in the fourth chapter of the letter from St. James.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Where do the wars and fighting among you come from?</strong> Don’t they come from your desires that war in your members? You lust, and don’t have. <strong>You murder and covet, and cannot obtain. You fight and make war.</strong> You do not have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires.<br>
 <br>
You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that <strong>friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</strong> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, <strong>“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil</strong>, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. <strong>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</strong>”</em><br>
-James 4:1-10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that at the end of the track “LUST.” from <em>DAMN.</em> Kendrick alluded to the biblical concept of “the world” and specifically referenced the fourth chapter of the letter of St. James.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lately, in <strong>James 4:4, friend of the world is enemy of the Lord</strong>.<br>
Brace yourself. Lust is all yours.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that “BLOOD.”, the first track on <em>DAMN.</em>, opens with an ominous voice which implies that weakness is the only other choice if one does not want to choose wickedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it wickedness or is it weakness.<br>
You decide.<br>
Are we going to live or die?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The choice between wickedness and weakness is a recurring motif throughout <em>DAMN.</em>, culminating in Kendrick’s breakthrough moment during “FEAR.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; creativity<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of missin&rsquo; out on you and me<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; loyalty from pride<br>
&lsquo;Cause my DNA won&rsquo;t let me involve in the light of God<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that my humbleness is gone<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that love ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; here no more<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, <strong>fear that it&rsquo;s wickedness or weakness</strong><br>
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae and Kendrick’s recognition that they need to embrace weakness in order to follow God is likely influenced by a passage from St. Paul’s second letter to the church in Corinth. In that passage. St. Paul writes about God allowed St. Paul to ensure a physical illness so that he would not become proud and so that he would learn that one must embrace one’s own weakness in order to be empowered by God’s strength.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I wil not boast on my own behalf, except in my weaknesses</strong>. For if I would like to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.<br>
 <br>
Because of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, so that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, so that I should not be exalted excessively. Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me. <strong>The Lord has said to me</strong>, “My grace is sufficient for you, for <strong>my power is made perfect in weakness</strong>.”<br>
 <br>
Most gladly therefore <strong>I will rather glory in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me</strong>. Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. <strong>For when I am weak, then am I strong</strong>.</em><br>
 <br>
-2 Corinthians 12:5-10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to people in “the world” thinking that Lecrae is weak, Lecrae also says that “the saints” will think that Lecrae is embarassing them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word “saint” means “holy person”, where the word “holy” refers to somone or something that is set apart of a unique purpose and is a source of life for others. In several of the New Testament letters, the church leader who wrote the letter addresses members of the chuch as “saints” or more specifially as “those who are called to be saints”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the fact that Christians are called to be holy people who are a source of life to others, Lecrae seems to be alluding to criticism that he perceives he will receive from many conservative Christians who want Lecrae to publically judge and condemn the people in “the world” who they think are behaving in ways that are evil or detrimental to society. If Lecrae does not publicalyl judge and condemn people engaged in such evil behavior, Lecrae perceives that this particular set of Christians will think that Lecrae is being to friendly with “the world” and thus is an embarassment to all Chrisitans.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Here Lecrae seems to be speaking directly to the “saints” who will say that Lecrae embarasses them and concedes that he walks “through the valleys full of evil”. By saying this Lecrae seems to be acknowledging that his mission has led him to work in close proximity to people who have turned away from the goodness of God and turned towards evil. For Lecrae, these “valleys” may represent various non-Christian environments including the music industry and mainstream hip hop culture.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae also seems to be alluding to Psalm 23 which is a poem written by King David to reflect on how God guides him through evil environments like a shepherd guides his sheep through dark, deadly valleys. The implication would be that Lecrae trusts God to help him navigate through the evils of the music industry and mainstream hip hop culture so that he can fulfill the mission that God has given him.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The LORD is my shepherd:<br>
I will lack nothing.<br>
He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br>
He leads me beside still waters.<br>
He restores my soul.<br>
He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.<br>
<strong>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br>
I will fear no evil</strong>, for you are with me.<br>
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me<br>
<strong>You prepare a table in front of me in the presence of my enemies</strong><br>
You anoint my head with oil<br>
My cup overflows<br>
Surlely goodness and loyal love will follow me all the days of my life<br>
And I will live in the house of the LORD forever</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As Lecrae responds to Christians who want him to judge people in the “valleys full of evil”, Lecrae seems to argue that way for him to condemn “the world” while being faithful to the mission that God has given him.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae is likely convinced that he cannot or really should not condemn “the world” because St. John’s account of the Gospel specifically highlights that God sent Jesus on a mission not to condemn “the world”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only born son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. <strong>For God did not send his Son to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him</strong>.</em><br>
-John 3:16-17</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae further highlights the infeasibility of condemning the world by saying that he can’t “burn all of the heretics”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the English-speaking world, the word “heretic” has historically referred to someone who was a member of a church or a citizen of a pre-modern Christian nation who insists on spreading ideas that seems to go against the Bible, teachings of Jesus or the interpretations of the church.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of pre-modern, Christian nations, it was not uncommon for heretics to be burned to death or receive some other form of capital punishment. Burning heretics was often justified as a way to prevent dangerous ideas from spreading and causing detrimental effects on society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This logical justification for burning heretics is essentially identical to the logic that Kendrick used to justify executing various people throughout “Watch the Party Die”, most notably when Kendrick said &ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because burning all the heretics did not stop ideas from spreading, did not preserve societal harmony and is now considered unthinkable in a modern, pluralistic, democratic society, Lecrae seems to be pointing out that condemning the world is totally infeasible and undesirable, even if he is incensed by modern heritics like the &ldquo;fake deep gurus pushin’ voodoo on the people, tellin’ folks that my God ain’t real&rdquo;.</p>
</li>

      <h4 id="love-is-patient-so-im-trustin-in-the-narrative--love-is-patient">&ldquo;Love is patient so I&rsquo;m trustin&rsquo; in the narrative&rdquo; &gt; Love is patient<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#love-is-patient-so-im-trustin-in-the-narrative--love-is-patient">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After stating that he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t condemn the world and burn all of the heretics&rdquo;, Lecrae once again emphasizes that he hopes to offer people Jesus’s love.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the word “love” can mean different things to different people in different contexts, Lecrae describes one of the core attributes of Jesus’s love by saying that “love is patient”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae is likely referencing a passage from St. Paul’s letter to the Church in the Greek city of Corinth. In that passage, St. Paul tries to teach the members of the Church that love is not about strong emotions or ecstatic experiences or sex. Instead, Paul describes love as a set of virtues that lead to right relationships.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong, or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Love is patient; love is kind; love is <strong>not envious or boastful or proud or rude</strong>. Love does not insist on its own way; love is not irritable or resentful; love does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.</strong><br>
 <br>
But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.<br>
 <br>
But now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. <strong>The greatest of these is love.</strong></em><br>
 <br>
-1 Corinthians 13:1-8,13</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, Lecrae may also be inspired by a passage from the second letter from St. Peter which explains that God is patient because he wants to give humans more time and opportunities to repent so that they do not keep going down a path that will lead to their own death and destruction.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Lord is not slow</strong> concerning his promise, as some count slowness; <strong>but he is patient with us, not wishing that anyone should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</strong></em><br>
-2 Peter 3:9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>God’s patience to prevent humans from dying contrasts sharply with the impatience that Kendrick displayed when he said that “I think it’s time to watch the party die.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that offering Jesus&rsquo;s love will require him to be patient with humans who “love to do evil” may lead to a lot of doubts about whether God will address the evil and injustice that continues to go on in parties throughout the world. However, rather than being overcome with doubt, Lecrae says that he is “trusting in the narrative”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea that offering Jesus&rsquo;s love will require him to be patient with humans who “love to do evil” may lead to a lot of doubts about whether God will address the evil and injustice that continues to go on in parties throughout the world. However,  rather than being overcome with doubt, Lecrae says that he is “trusting in the narrative.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Lecrae seems to be referring to the “biblical narrative”, or the overarching flow of events that are recounted over the course of the Bible.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In summary, the biblical narrative tells the story of how&hellip;<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>God created the world and gave humans the responsibility of ruling the world on God’s behalf.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, instead of ruling by God’s definition of good, humans redefined good and evil based on their own limited perspective, which led to broken trust and broken relationships in families and in society.<br>
 </li>
<li>God promised that one day a human would come to rule the world based on God’s definition of good and resist the temptation to rule on his terms.<br>
 </li>
<li>Numerous characters were given the opportunity to rule but eventually started to rule on their own terms which leads to a world of violence and injustice.<br>
 </li>
<li>After so many failed leaders, God the Father sent Jesus as the Son of God from heaven down to earth to speak and act in a way that would show humans how to rule by God’s definition of good, even when doing so led his enemies to kill him.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus then resurrected from the dead to show that following God’s definition of God leads to a new kind of life that will endure beyond physical death.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus instructed his disciples to spread his teachings, the example of way of life and the surprising announcement of his death and resurrection to people from nations all over the world so that they could turn towards what is good and turn away from what is evil.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus then ascended back up into the heavens and told his disciples to be patient and wait for the day when Jesus will back to earth to rid the world of evil once and for all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae seems to see himself in that final section of the narrative where he must be patient and wait for Jesus to come back, rid the world of evil, and finally put an end to the “party”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of being patient and waiting for Jesus to come back to earth and bring a resolution to the narrative is something that Kendrick also expressed during <em>DAMN.</em>’s  breakthrough moment on the track “FEAR.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
And I can&rsquo;t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse<br>
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br>
<strong>Searchin&rsquo; for resolutions until somebody get back</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <h4 id="and-christ-aint-watch-the-party-die-he-died-instead-of-it--die-for-the-party">&ldquo;And Christ ain&rsquo;t watch the party die, He died instead of it&rdquo; &gt; Die for the party<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#and-christ-aint-watch-the-party-die-he-died-instead-of-it--die-for-the-party">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae ends his verse by flipping the phrase “Watch the Party Die” and declaring that Jesus is the anointed king (aka Christ) who died instead of the party.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This final line is thus a restatement of the track’s title “Die for the Party”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of Jesus Christ dying for &ldquo;the party&rdquo; echoes St. Paul’s words from his letter to the Church in Rome where he taught that Jesus is the anointed king (aka Christ) who died on behalf of sinners (i.e. people who failed to act in a way that would create justice and right relationships) at the right time.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For while we were yet weak, <strong>at the right time Christ died for the ungodly</strong>. For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a good person someone would even dare to die. But <strong>God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</strong>.</em><br>
-Romans 5:6-8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of Jesus dying in the place of a sinner is also vividly depicted during the scene of Jesus’s trial in St. John’s account of the Gospel. In that scene, the Roman governor determined that Jesus was not guilty of any crime under Roman law. However, because the Judean leaders wanted to kill Jesus, the Roman governor offered to release a man who was guilty of armed robbery and leading a violent revolt against the occupying Romans and have Jesus die in place of the rebel leader.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pilate, <strong>the Roman governor</strong>, came out again <strong>to the Judeans</strong> and said to them, “I find no grounds at all for charges in His case. However, <strong>you have a custom that I release one prisoner</strong> for you at the Passover; therefore <strong>do you wish that I release for you the King of the Judeans?</strong>”<br>
 <br>
Then <strong>the Judeans shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a [rebel / revolutionary / robber]</strong>.<br>
 <br>
Then Pilate, the Roman governor, <strong>took Jesus and had Jesus flogged. And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head</strong>, and put a purple cloak on Him; and they repeatedly came up to Him and said, <strong>“Hail, King of the Judeans!” and slapped Him in the face again and again.</strong></em><br>
-John 18:38-40</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, with this final line, Lecrae is saying that Jesus died so that killers, evil doers, abusers, liars, scammers, vultures, degenerates, drug dealers, crooked doctors, fake tough rappers, fake deep gurus and everyone else that Kendrick and Lecrae might have wanted to die do not actually have to die.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than being the time to watch the party die, God seems to be giving these people some additional time to turn away from evil, turn towards the goodness of God and begin a new way of life before the party really has to end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
