“Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham who is better known by his middle name Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.

  "articleBody": "“Watch the Party Die” by Kendrick Lamar [Verse 1] I think it’s time to watch the party die Pedophile parties “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Pedophile parties “Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham who is better known by his middle name Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin’ I wanted to crash your party The first line of “Watch the Party Die” thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick’s battle with Drake.\nAmong the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.\nSandra, sit down, what I’m about to say is heavy, now listen\nMm-mm, your son’s a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualizes ’em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein’ a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin’ his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin’ there’s predators like him lurkin’\n…\nThey be streamlinin’ victims all inside of they home and callin’ ’em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas\n…\nKatt Williams said, “Get you the truth,” so I’ma get mines\nThe Embassy ‘bout to get raided too, it’s only a matter of time\nAyy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away\nTo anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away\nThey lookin’ at you too if you standin’ by him, keep the family away\nI’m lookin’ to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe In these lyrics from “meet the grahams”, Kendrick asserts that sexual predators like Drake or Harvey Weinstein should die, much like the party in “Watch the Party Die”. Kendrick also recounts a message from Black comedian, Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth”. Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview which was released by Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these predatory practices.\nYears before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offences and been given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since at the time Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assaut but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the interview (15:40 - 16:32) Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.\nI came in this business saying I was going to expose. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. It’s God’s side and the other side and we don’t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024. It’s up for all of them. It don’t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is. TD Jakes - any of them the every…All lies will be exposed. That’s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. The truth is the light.\n…\nAll people that love the truth got to be happy if the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That’s just what time it is - 2024, folks.\nIn the interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00), Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy’s parties and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities he consistently refused to attend the parties because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties.\nMy goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis. That was my only goal.\n…\nI’ve had to turn down $50 million four times - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, “No.” You’ve got to tell him, “No.” I did.\nHence by saying “I think it’s time to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with - or maybe fulfilling - Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them”.\nAgain, the idea that it is almost “time” for the criminal offences of Drake and his crew will soon be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on “meet the grahams” when he predicted a police raid on Drake’s mansion, which is nicknamed “The Embassy”.\nKatt Williams said, “Get you the truth,” so I’ma get mines\nThe Embassy ‘bout to get raided too, it’s only a matter of time A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would go on to release the album GNX featuring the opening track “wacced out murals” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that truth is about to be exposed.\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\nMake Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ‘bout to get loud It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized allegations.\nFor instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14 year old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31 year old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently including Drake sending a message that said “I miss you so much” to which she replied “I miss you more”. She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.\nA year later, in 2019, roughly 5 years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes ’em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next 5 years.\n“Dude R. Kelly got away”\n“That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake’s gonna be …he’s on that R. Kelly tip.”\n“You think so?”\n“Drizzy Drake likes ’em young. He does. It’s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, ‘I don’t know.’ Drake, Drizzy Drake is into the young ones. He’s going to get got in the next 5 years, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.”\nKendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us”. In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.\nSay, Drake, I hear you like ’em young\nYou better not ever go to cell block one\nTo any bitch that talk to him and they in love\nJust make sure you hide your lil’ sister from him\nThey tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs\nAnd Party at the party playin’ with his nose now\nAnd Baka got a weird case, why is he around?\nCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck ’em up\nWop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I’ma do my stuff\nWhy you trollin’ like a bitch? Ain’t you tired?\nTryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor Perverting God’s plan “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Perverting God’s plan The pedophelia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\n…\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a fan\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nThe association with simultaneous oral sex is due to the fact that the number 6 looks like a number 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees\nAside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament the “devil” (meaning “diabolical one”, “false accuser” or “liar” ) - also known as the “satan” (meaning “adversary”) - is often depicted as a figure who unlike God cannot actually create anything. Instead the “devil” / “satan” will take things that have been created by the one true God and uses lies to twist or turn them upside down.\nIn his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the “devil” / “satan” cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.\nThese people are not powerful. Satan can’t create anything that includes blessings for his people. That’s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn’t happen. They all do the same job.\nIn English the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the “devil” / “satan” or someone who behaves like the “devil” / “satan” uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing towards an evil purpose. The word “pervert” is derived from the Latin word “perverto” which means “to turn thoroughly”. Someone who habitually “perverts” good things can themselves be refered to with the noun “pervert”. Notably, Kendrick refered to Drake as a “pervert” on “meet the graham”.\nI’m lookin’ to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake - the self-proclaimed “6 god” - has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan”, in reference to Drake’s hit single.\nUltimately, the goal of the “devil” / “satan” is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God”. This pattern of lying is first depicted when the “devil” / “satan” takes on the form of snake which deceives the prototypical man and woman to eat the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.\nNow the snake was more shrewd than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”\nThe woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’”\nThe snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.\nIn the case of Kendrick’s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to reprsent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.\nSex god “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Sex god Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to a sexual acts, Kendrick seems to depicting Drake as a “sex god”. In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus and Liber were worshiped throughout the world including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East where most of the events of the Bible take place.\nIn many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.\nIn the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.\nHence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution. Drake denies the allegations “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Drake denies the allegations After the release of “meet the grahams” and “Not Like Us”, Drake released “The Heart Part 6” where Drake publicly denied the pedophelia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick’s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick’s track “mother i sober” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.\nSpeakin’ of anything with a child, let’s get to that now\nThis Epstein angle was the shit I expected\nTikTok videos you collected and dissected\nInstead of bein’ on some diss-direct shit\nYou rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit\nMy mom came over today, and I was like, “Mother, I—\nMother, I—, mother—,” ahh, wait a second\nThat’s that one record where you say you got molested\nAw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection\nThis about to get so depressin’\nThis is trauma from your own confessions\nThis when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected\nThat’s why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it’s so excessive\nThey actin’ like it’s so aggressive, but you just never known affection\nI don’t wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin’\n“Touch My Body” by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin’\nI never been with no one underage,\nbut now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with\nJust for clarity, I feel disgusted, I’m too respected\nIf I was fucking young girls, I promise I’d have been arrested\nI’m way too famous for this shit you just suggested\nBut that’s not the lesson, clearly, there’s a deeper message\n…\nDrake is not a name that you gon’ see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It You mentionin’ A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, “Who was it?” You thought you left D flat, D major …\nOnly fuckin’ with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I’d never look twice at no teenager\n…\nIf you still bumpin’ R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior This shit done got too wicked to apologize Wickedness or weakness “This shit done got too wicked to apologize” \u003e Wickedness or weakness Kendrick seems to be asserting that “the party” has become become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending “the party” have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.\nKendrick’s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy’s “Freak Off” sex parties which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficing, recketeering transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry as exposed by Katt Williams.\nIt is notable that that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album DAMN.. The album’s opening track, “BLOOD.” begins with the with an ominous voice which that says:\nIs it wickedness or is it weakness?\nYou decide. Are we going to live or die?”\nThroughout DAMN. Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the “wickedness” that is routinely perpetrated by poweful, violent men in this world and the “weakness” that was exhibited by Jesus who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you, and you and me\n-“PRIDE.”\nDamn, love or lust\nDamn, all of us\n-“LOVE”\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\n-“XXX.”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me involve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin’ for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can’t take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin’ if I’m livin’ through fear or livin’ through rap\nDamn\n-“FEAR.” Give that throughout DAMN. Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from way of wickeness would require him to turn towards Jesus’s way of weakess, it is ironic that throughout “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultanelous building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.\nWicked sexual behavior in the Bible “This shit done got too wicked to apologize” \u003e Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of “Watch the Party Die”, it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at “the party” are “too wicked to apologize.”\nIn a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men whar are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels form getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone and the city soon gets destroyed by a fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.\nIn a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor’s wife leads to a civil war where thousand of men are killed. We war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed feast capture teenage girls from festal celebrationand force them into marriage.\nIn a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David immediately is overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman’s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David’s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba has be pregnant he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.\nLecrae refernces this story of King David’s sexual misconduct with Bathseba and murder of Uriah on “Die for the Party” when he raps:\nBut when I take a look in the mirror\nThe blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters\nGod soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51 in which King Devil acknowleges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness\nThat being said, despite King David’s repentance, the son that was born from King David’s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David’s second son - who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped - exeuted a plot to murder the oldest son. King David’s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to raped all of King David’s lower status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.\nOne of the major lessons of King David’s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real world consequences for David, his family and the whole society around King David.\nKendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick’s album good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick released the track “The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)” where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.\nWith a Bible and rifle: I play the game as I “blam-blaow!”\nHoller back at me, nigga\nAnd if they said that I’m the one, why you asking me, nigga?\n‘Cause when the whole world see you as ‘Pac reincarnated\nEnough pressure to make you just open the Book of David\nAnd pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix\n‘Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it’s quite contagious\nGiven that Kendrick knows the story of King David wicked behavior and subsequent aplology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy or or any of the men who have participated in “the party” can ever truly apology or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.\nFrom a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that would him to justify the use of violence eliminate his enemies or those whom he considers to be an enemy of society, which is exactly what he does throughout the rest of “Watch the Party Die”.\nIt’s different, get him whacked and disqualified Wacced out partygoers “It’s different, get him wacced and disqualified” \u003e Wacced out partygoers By saying “It’s different”, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that the wickedness of the hosts and attendees of “the party” is on a totally different level than other negative behavior or even criminal offences that could be considered forgivable. From Kendrick’s perspective, this different level of wickedness seems be justice getting these partygoers “wacced” and “disqualified”.\n“Wacced” is slang for destroyed, defaced or disrespected.\nThe use of the word “wacced” would go on to become more notable a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick released the album GNX which opens with the track “wacced out murals”. On “wacced out murals”, Kendrick expresses anger after an unknown graffiti vandalizer “wacced out” a mural on the side of a Compton restaurant that a visual artist had created to honor Kendrick. The vandlism included Kendrick’s face covered with the letter “OVO” in reference to Drake’s OVO crew and record label which is a acronym for “October’s Very Own”.\nYesterday, somebody wacced out my mural\nThat energy’ll make you niggas move to Europe\nBut it’s regular for me, yeah, that’s for sure\nThe love and hate is definite without a cure\nA video of the vandalizer spraying graffiti on Kendrick’s mural was first posted to social media on September 8, 2024, just 3 days before the release of “Watch the Party Die.” One could reasonably suppose that the release of “Watch the Party Die” on September 11 was partially a response to Kendrick’s mural getting vandalized.\nOne can also reasonably argue that “wacced out murals” is essentially a simplified spiritual successor to “Watch the Party Die”. “wacced out murals” seems crafted to allow listeners to “feel” the vitriol of “Watch the Party Die” without having to closely analyize the lyrics and discover the double entendres. This connection can be seen in the verses of “wacced out murals” where Kendrick threatens to “eliminate” anyone who is on “the other side” (i.e. not on God’s side). The third verse in particular also contains a direct reference to “Watch the Party Die” and to Katt Williams calling for the truth to be exposed.\nIt used to be fuck that nigga, but now it’s plural\nFuck everybody, that’s on my body\nMy blick first, then God got me\n…\nThis is not for lyricists, I swear it’s not the sentiments\nFuck a double entendre, I want y’all to feel this shit\n…\nOkay, nigga, let’s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal\nSince y’all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you\nOkay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die\nNiggas cackling about— while all of y’all is on trial\n…\nAyy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow\nA bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with ’em in style\nExterminate ’em right now\nMake Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ‘bout to get loud\n…\nI know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that’s close to them\nThe niggas that coon, the niggas that bein’ groomed, slide on both of them Someone is typically “disqualified” from an activity or competition when they are exposed for lying, cheating or behaving in a way that is illegal or unethical. In the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick could be saying that rappers like Drake should be disqualified from the “rap game” or more specifically from the competition of being considered the greatest rapper.\nAt the same time, based on the violent language throughout “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick might also be claiming that the hosts and attendees of “the party” should be disqualified from the most basic activity of living life.\nWe even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives Killing the killers “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Killing the killers Kendrick seems to indicate that he and the peopole associated with him have already decided to kill anyone who is guilty of killing someone innocent.\nThe first three lines of “Watch the Party Die” have expressed significant amounts of animosity and vitriol. However, this fourth line is the first instance where Kendrick explicitly advocates for death sentences and targeted executions as an act of vigilante justice where an individual or group without any legal authority decide to take the law into their own hands in order to punish offenders or address perceived injustices. Within the context of this track, Kendrick is establishing himself as the judge and jury while enlisting his supporters to join him as executioners.\nThe idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” brings up a longstanding political, sociological and philosophical debate about the best way to respond to potential wrongdoing, establish justice and maintain an orderly society. Within the large debate it should be noted that more than 50 countries including the United States of America currently execute individuals who have been convincted of a crime that the justice system considers particularly egregious or distabilizing to social order.\nIn America, crimes that are eligible for the death penalty tend to be ones that invole intentionally or unintentionally killing someone innocent whether through murder, terrorism, kidnapping, sexual assault, or drug trafficking. In contrast, European countries in the European Union have abolished the death penalty as punishment for crimes. However, historically most civilizations in human history have had some form of death penalty, often for crimes that did not involve killing anyone - including theft, adultery, sexual misbehavior, disrespecting a member of a higher class, and speaking against the state government or the state religion.\nWhile America and many other modern nations still justify the use of death sentences after a fair trial, all modern nation states - at least officially - oppose the use of individuals or groups taking the law into their own hands through vigilante justice. However, on an individual basis, many people do seem ready to accept, support and even celebrate a vigilante execution that is executed against someone whom they truly despise, even if that person has not broken any laws. Current events “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Current events A few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” this inclination for Americans to accept, support and even celebrate vigilante executions came to the surface after a 26-year old named Luigi Mangione gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare medical health insurance company. According to publish excerpts from Luigi Mangione’s writings, he claims to have targed the UnitedHealthcare CEO due to his belief that UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies “have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit”.\nImmediately after the shooting and even before his identity was uncovered, Luigi Magnione became a kind of a folk hero as countless people across social media platforms expressed agreement with the Mangione’s assessment that “these parasites simply had it coming” and joined the shooter in expressing anger and vitriol against health insurance companies. This sentiment was widely expressed that Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsyvania were Mangione was arrested, gave a press conference where he said “In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero hear me on this he is no hero.”\nOn an international, geopolitical scale, the idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” has also been expressed in the context of war. In 2024, much of this justification has come from manypeople on both sides of the Israel vs. Hamas conflict that began on October 7, 2023, 11 months before the release of “Watch the Party Die” after Hamas killed 1,195 Israelis, took 248 Israelis as hostages and - based on a few sources - sexually assaulted and gang raped numerous Israelis during the October 7 attack. Many people who supported the plight of the Palestinians justified the attack as a necessary response to how Israelis had previously killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Meanwhile, many supporter of Israel’s War in Gaza justified killing the killers of innocent Israelies even tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed and two thirds of Gaza’s buildings were damaged or destroyed.\nWhile “Watch the Party Die” does not specifially address current events such at the War in Gaza and was released months before Luigi Mangione’s vigilante execution, both of these current events reveal the cultural zeigtgeist in which which Kendrick wrote, recorded and released “Watch the Party Die”. Kendrick’s catalogue “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives” \u003e Kendrick’s catalogue Kendrick has explored the idea of killing the killers at length in his previous work most notably on the track “XXX.” from DAMN. On the first verse of “XXX.” Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) tells a story about a distressed friend who asked for advice on how to respond after gang members killed his son. Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) acknowledged that as a anointed (i.e. Christian) individual he theoretically knew better, but felt strongly that the friend should kill his sons killer.\nYesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101\nSaid they killed his only son because of insufficient funds\nHe was sobbin’, he was mobbin’, way belligerent and drunk\nTalkin’ out his head, philosophin’ on what the Lord had done\nHe said, “K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me\nI know that you anointed, show me how to overcome”\nHe was lookin’ for some closure, hopin’ I could bring him closer\nTo the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him\n“I can’t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\nAin’t no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward\nI can’t even keep the peace, don’t you fuck with one of ours\nIt be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour\nMeanwhile the second verse of “XXX.” explored how the inclination towards violence and killing the killers is a common pattern of thought within the American psyche in contrast to the mentality that was exemplified by Jesus.\nHail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph\nThe great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts, Donald Trump’s in office\nWe lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\nPass the gin, I mix it with American blood\nThen bash him in, you Crippin’ or you married to Blood?\nI’ll ask again, oops, accident\nIt’s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmerica’s reflections of me, that’s what a mirror does It is also notable that on “Worldwide Steppers” from Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper Kendrick asserted that we are all killers who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly cause the deaths of innocent people.\nI’m a killer, he’s a killer, she’s a killer, bitch\nWe some killers, walkin’ zombies, tryna scratch that itch\n..\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology\nSilent murderer, what’s your body count? Who your sponsorship?\nObjectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)\nThe media’s the new religion, you killed the consciousness (What the fuck?)\nYour jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)\nNiggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)\n..\nI caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community\nMy last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies\nNot because the rags in the park had red gradient\nBut because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin’\nSo what’s the difference ’tween your life when hiding motives?\nMore fatalities and reality bring you closure\nThe noble person that goes to work and pray like they ‘posed to?\nSlaughter people too, your murder’s just a bit slower\nIf we apply the logic of “Wordlwide Steppers” to this current line on “Watch the Party Die”, the natural conclusion would suggest that beyond the powerful men who exploit, coerce and sexually abuse victims at parties, there is a much wider set of people whom Kendrick could justifiable kill through his vigilante executions.\nAt the same time, we should note that on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick first and foremost acknowledges that he himself is a killer in part due to his catering choices which might lead innocent children to long-term health complications and shortened lifespans. If we apply that logic from “Worldwide Steppers” to this line from “Watch the Party Die” it would seem that Kendrick is being a hypocrite for justifying his desire to kill the people who he despises while not acknowledging that he also deserves to be killed.\nIn contrast, on “Die for the Party” Lecrae looks at the man in the mirror, sees that he himself is a killer and a hyprocrite which leads him to acknowledge that he deserves death along with all the other hypocrites.\nIt’s killers sittin’ in they cell for takin’ somebody innocent\nAnd they don’t even feel no remorse, the worst ignorance\nBut when I take a look in the mirror\nThe blood of Uriah’s on my hands ‘cause I’m that killer\nWho had Bathsheba in his quarters\nI’m that- who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I’m that sinner\nI deserve death along with all these liars and hypocrites Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time Justification “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Justification Burning the whole village with men, women and children would normally be seen as an act of injustice and inhumane brutality. However, if everyone is a killer, Kendrick seems to have no issue with any collateral damage that he would cause while trying to exterminate the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party”.\nThe justification for burning the whole village naturlaly follows from the idea that we are all killers and the idea that we should kill the killers who like taking innocent lives.\nBy saying “it’s really that time”, Kendrick connects the idea of burning the whole village to the opening line “I think it’s time to watch the party die”. Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament From a biblical perspective, the idea of a whole village being burned does bring to mind the Old Testament story of Sodom and Gomorrah where two towns of rapists were destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies, as I mentioned in the “Wicked sexual misbehavior in the Bible” section.\nThe motif of fire coming down from the sky gets further developed in the stories about the Prophet Elijah, who served as a prophet to the Northern Kingdom of Israel which had its capital in a city called Samaria.\nAround 50 years earlier The Northern Kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria had split from the Southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem after a rebellion and a near civil war.\nThis split would be the begnning of a animosity between Samaria and Judah that would continue to escalate for centuries.\nIn English, the name Judah which was later shortened to the word “Jew”, which is the word that is now used to refer to the ethnic group that is originally from this geographic area and the religion that was originally practided by this ethnic group.\nAt the time, Israel had almost entirely turned away from worshiping God and were instead worship a fertility and sex god named Ba’al. As part of the worship of this fertility god, the Isrealites presumably would have been going to the god Ba’al’s temple to participate in feasts and have ritualized sex with temple prostitutes.\nThe worship of Ba’al was introduced to the Kingdom of Israel by a king named Ahab who “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” King Ahab married a princess named Jezebel from one of the neighboring nations which God had specifically forbidden the Israelites from entering into marriage relationships because those nations worshiped false gods like the fertility god Ba’al.\nAccording to a prophesy from Elijah, God stopped the sky from raining any water to prove that worshiping the fertility and sex god Ba’al would actually diminish the land’s agricultural fertility and, as a consequence, also diminish the sexual fertility amongst the Israelites. This prophesy angered King Ahab and Queen Jezebel who then unsuccessfully tried to murder Elijah.\nAt some point after Ahab’s son succeeded Ahab as king, God sent Elijah to confront the king about the ongoing worship of Ba’al. The king sent a military captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah. However, Elijah called down fire from the skies which came down and burned the captain and all the soldiers to death. he king then sent another captain with fifty of soldiers to kill Elijah but they too were burned to death when Elijah called down fire from the skies. Finally, a last captain of fifty soldiers came and humbled himself before Elijah, who this time did not call down fire on the soldiers. (See 2 Kings 1:1-15) Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Refusing fire from heaven in the New Testament Given the motif of fire raining down from the skies to destroy the wicked in the Old Teastament, it is notable that one particular New Testament story in St. Luke’s account of the Gospel (aka “Good News”) seems to intentionally undermine the desire one might have for God to send fire to destroy one’s enemies. (See Luke 9:52-56)\nIn that story, Jesus and his disciple go to a village in Samaria, the same city where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had long ago led the Israelites to worship the fertility and sex god, Ba’al.\nDuring the time of Jesus, the people of Samaria did worship Yahweh the God of Israel, but the Samaritans and the Judeans considered each other to be be enemies because:\nThe Judeans considered the Samaritans to be “heretics” who did not worship Yahweh in the way that Yahweh was supposed to be worshiped.\nAbout 550 years earlier, the Samaritans had tried to prevent the Judeans from building a temple in Jerusalem.\nAbout 140 years earlier, earlier there was a military campaign in which the Judeans from Jerusalem destroyed the Samaritan’s temple to Yahweh, killed lots of people and destroyed their capital city. As Jesus entered the Sameritan village, Jesus’s followers announced him as the rightful king of the Judeans who was on his way to Jerusalem to be crowned and enthroned as king. However, due the the longstanding hatred between Judeans and Samaritans, the Samaritans did not accept Jesus and expressed visible hostility to Jesus’s arrival.\nTwo of Jesus’s disciples, St James and St. John, seemed to have been greatly displeased by the cold reception that the Samaritans were giving to Jesus. Likey influenced by their own hatred of the Samaritans, Jesus’s two disciples asked Jesus:\n“Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” Jesus immediately became angry with those two disciples and strongly criticized them by saying:\n“You do not know what kind of spirit you belong to. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy human lives, but to [save / rescue / heal] them.”\nNote: The term “Son of Man” is how Jesus typically referred to himself in the Gospel accounts (See the Bible Project Son of Man video). By expressinging his desire to “burn the whole village”, Kendrick seems to be exhibiting the same misguided way of thought as the disciples who wanted to destroy their enemies in the name of serving Jesus. In doing so, James, John and Kendrick totally disregarded Jesus’s desire to have his enemies apologize, repent and allow Jesus to save, rescue, and heal their lives.\nCurrent events “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time” \u003e Current events Within the context of current events in 2024, one can also see the Israeli military action against Hamas and the resulting damage or destruction of two thirds of buildings in Gaza an example of the Israeli government deciding that it is justifable to “burn the whole village” in order to kill the killers who executed the October 7, 2023 attack. Why reason with these niggas if they can't see the future first?\nWhy argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work? Justification “Why reason…Why reason…” \u003e Justification Kendrick seems to claim that it is futile to use reason or rational arguments to convince the wicked party hosts and attendees to change their ways. These statements seem to provide further justification for his desire to kill anyone who has taken innocent lives. Future first “Why reason with these niggas if they can’t see the future first?” \u003e Future first The phrase “see the future first” could be a reference to Frank Ocean’s track, “Nikes”.\nWe’ll let you guys prophesy\nWe gon’ see the future first\nLiving so the last night feels like a past life\nSpeakin’ of the, don’t know what got into people\nDevil be possessin homies\nDemons try to body jump In the context of “Nikes”, the people who “see the future first” seem to be the ones who truly have a prophetic vision. These true prophets stand in contrast to those who talk as if they can prophesy but are not actually able to see the future in advance.\nKendrick has repeatedly identified himself as a prophet most prominently on the final track of To Pimp a Butterfly and on several tracks that were released in subsequent years. I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain’t a prophet ’til they ask you this question\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n-“Mortal Man”\nThe reason my power’s here on earth\nSalute the truth, when the prophet say\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\n-“DNA.”\nI’m not a trending topic, I’m a prophet\nI answer to Metatron and Gabriel\n-“family ties” In the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick also seems to compare himself and the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry to the biblical prophet Elijah and the wicked Queen Jezebel who tried to imprison and kill all the true prophets of God who spoke truth while giving prominent positions to false prophets who told lies.\nIt’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified\nThe end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies Hence, we could interpret the current line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to reason with rappers and members of the entertainment industry who profit from telling lies.\nCircus clowns “Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work?” \u003e Circus clowns The word “clown” is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who acts foolishly in a way that attracts a lot of attention.\nThe word “circus” can also be used as a pejorative to describe an environment that is overcrowded, noisy and chaotic. This pejorative meaning of the word “circus” could potentially be used to description of the “party”, particularly since a party and a circus are both forms of communal entertainment.\nHence, we could interpret this line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to argue with the rappers who and members of the entertainment industry who are working for the circus. Just walk that man down, that’ll do everyone a solid Walk down “Just walk that man down, that’ll do everyone a solid” \u003e Walk down “Walking someone down” is a slang term which refers to premediated murder, particularly in a shooting where the shooter calmly executes his target.\nIn “euphoria” Kendrick confronts Drake while rapping:\nHave you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?\nHere in “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick seems to inciting his supporters to kill the killers who like taking innocent lives. Kendrick justifies such murders by saying it will “do everyone a solid” which is a colloquial way of saying that killing such people will do everyone a favor.\nSimilar to earlier line where Kendrick said “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives”, it seems approximate to point out that a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” this logic was used by significant numbers of people to justify Luigi Mangione’s decision to kill the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. For example, in one popular video the host defends the shooters actions and fittingly refers to the shooter as “Run ’em down Jake” prior to the shooter’s name being discovered and publicized.\nIt’s love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence Tough love “It’s love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence” \u003e Tough love The term “tough love” is stereotypically used by parents (particularly dads) to refer to painful discipline that is meant to benefit a child in the long run.\nKendrick specifically mentions “tough love” to describe the parenting Kendrick received from his father on the Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper track “Father Time”.\nDaddy issues ball across my head, told me, “Fuck a foul”\nI’m teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won’t think out loud …\nDaddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don’t take those well\nMomma said, “That boy is exhausted,” he said, “Go fuck yourself\nIf he give up now, that’s gon’ cost him, life’s a bitch\nYou could be a bitch or step out the margin,” I got up quick\nI’m chargin’ baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance\nOh, this the part where mental stability meets talent\nOh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice\nTactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues\n…\nEarly mornin’ wake-ups (Ah), practicin’ on day-offs (Ah)\nTough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)\n…\nI got daddy issues, that’s on me\nLookin’ for, “I love you”, rarely empathizin’ for my relief\nA child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee\n‘Cause if I cried about it, he’d surely tell me not to be weak\nDaddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself\nMen should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped It is notable that “Father Time” is one of the few tracks where Kendrick mentioned Drake by name prior to the feud.\nDaddy issues kept me competitive, that’s a fact, nigga\nI don’t give a fuck what’s the narrative, I am that nigga\nWhen Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused\nGuess I’m not mature as I think, got some healin’ to do Given that on “Father Time” Kendrick higlighted how “tough love” can instill unhealthy patterns of thoughts and lead to immature competitiveness, it is ironic for inconisistent for Kendrick to justify the use of violence against his enemies by claiming it is a result of “tough love\".\nKendrick also hinted at the idea of tough love leading to violence on “euphoria” when alluded to rapper YNW Melly. YNW Melly, whose legal last name is ironically “Demons”, released a hit single called “Murder on My Mind” in June 2018 just a few months before a shooting in which he was later accused of murdering two of his close friends, rappers YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.\nIt’s three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin’ and huggin’ on stage\nI love ’em to death and in eight bars, I’ll explain that phrase, huh\n…\nI pray they my real friends, if not, I’m YNW Melly . If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth\nThe graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose Gluttony “If you parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” \u003e Gluttony Kendrick now seems to be targeting rappers, social media influencers and other members the entertainment industry who glorify greed, instant gratification and conspicuous, unhealthy consumption, particularly when such individuals never actually offer truth to innocent youth whose lives may be shortened if they immitate the examples that are given to them by the entertainment indudstry.\nKendrick has discussed the theme of unhealthy consumption throughout his career.\nThe track “Vanity Slaves” from the Kendrick Lamar EP explores the ways in which Black people in America have become enslaved to White-owned businesses and corporations who lead Black people into financial mismanagement and ruin. From this perspective, Kendrick could make a compelling case that parading gluttony leads to generational racial injustice that dehumanizes Black people much like slavery.\nI care about my pride too much\nIf my clothes is new, if my ride is plush\nIf my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed\nI look in the mirror, I’m trendy enough? Wrong\nInsecurity roams the black community\nHomes where kids must have jewelry\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt’s not about the right price but more like the right scam\nTo rule us all, confuse us all\nHit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw\nNow let’s draw\nThe picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for\nMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a house\nThat lives around his neck like a white collar\nSo why fast forward?

(Interlude)” on To Pimp a Butterfly, parading gluttony to tempt young Black people is a satanic plot that is utilized by Lucy (aka Lucifer / the satan / the devil / the false accuser / the adversary / the diabolical one).\nWhat you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?\nForty acres and a mule?

Within the logic of “LUST” demonic forces seem to be at work under the surface in ways that we normally don’t notice and thus don’t realize how Black people are being enslaved in a way that is arguably too wicked to apologize.\nWake up in the mornin’, thinkin’ ‘bout money, kick your feet up\nWatch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up\nGo hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don’t go to work today\nCop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today\nHang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama\nSip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window\nBet your favorite team, play you some Madden\nGo to the club or your mama house\nWhatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water) Wake up in the morning, thinking ‘bout money, kick your feet up\nHop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up\nTouch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain’t shit\nCredit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent\nHop on the ‘Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin’ on you\nPop you a pill, call up your bitches, have ’em waitin’ on you\nGo to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce\nIt’s whatever, just make it count At the end of “LUST.”, Kendrick references a New Testament Bible passage that speakes directly to the dangers of being controlled by gluttony and lust.\nLately, in James 4:4 says\n“Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord”\nBrace yourself: Lust is all yours James 4:4 refers to a section of teaching that St. James, the step brother of Jesus, gave to Christians who were getting into conflicts because of their lust, gluttony and desire for all material possession that can be obtained in this world. St. James warns these Christians that living in this way leads to pride (i.e. exalting themselves above other to get what they want). Morover, St. James warns that those who become proud become enemies of God, who opposes those who are proud and gives grace to those who are humble.\nWhere do wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your body parts? You lust, and do not have. You murder and want what someone else has, and can’t obtain it. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires. You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Therefore submit yourself to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you inconsistent people. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. Graveyard “The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose” \u003e Graveyard By saying “The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose”, Kendrick is asserting that those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” are guratneed to be executed alongside the killers who “like taking innocent lives”.\nSince their deaths are all but certain, Kendrick cold-heartedly recommends that these people should make plans for their own funeral. Since these people have been so consumed by their own vanity for commercialized products, Kendrick seems to suggest that they should take the time to pick the casket that will allow them to take their vanity to the grave. They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card Scamming “They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card” \u003e Scamming On a few tracks over the years, Kendrick has ointed out the destructive pattern of Black people using credit card scams to illegally get money to pay for their unhealthy consumption habits, addictions or desire to be lazy.\nBaby wanna go back to school, but she need some help\nBecause it’s hard trying to pay the bills when you’re by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams, ’til she heard a voice\nThat said, “The Devil is a lie, make a better choice”\n-“Faith”\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt’s not about the right price but more like the right scam\n-\"“Vanity Slaves”\"\nCredit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent\n-“LUST.” Chipped “They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card” \u003e Chipped Getting “chipped” is a slang term for getting killed, particularly by gunshots that are fired to put an end a conflict, as can be heard in several of Kendrick’s past tracks.\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\n…\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\n…\nLet somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman\nTouch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother\nYou should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\n-“XXX.”\nI come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor\nRebellious and Margielas’ll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\n-“The Heart Part 5”\nHellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay\nEverybody wanna be demon ’til they get chipped by a throwaway\n-“euphoria” In the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick seems to be saying that rappers, influencers and members of the entertainment industry who “glorify scamming” will soon get “chipped” by the people who are carrying out Kendrick’s execution orders.\nInfluencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit Influencers “Influencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit” \u003e Influencers Here Kendrick seems to criticizing social media influencers who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”. These influencers are often followed by thousands or even millions of impressionable young people. Once they amass a significant number of followers, these particular influencers profit from convincing young people that they need to buy sponsored products which may then lead young people to steal money through credit card scams.\nIt is worth noting that in the years prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die” several social science research studies published papers which found connections between materialistic social media content and problematic consumption behavior among young people.\nTo further magnify their influence, these influencers seem to have a pattern of exalting themsevles so that they can “talk down” at people like Kendrick. Basic “Influencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit” \u003e Basic In slang usage, the word “basic” is a pejoritive that describes something that is mainsteam, popular and trending or someone who is unrefined and boring because they only like things that are mainsteam, popular and trending.\nFor Kendrick “basic shit” from the mainstream entertainment industry seems to be the exact opposite of the thoughful, complex and creative aristry that has defined Kendrick’s career, most notably with Kendrick’s album, DAMN. winning a Pulitzer Prize.\nOn the track “Poetic Justice” (ft. Drake) from good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick highlights how finding someone who is not “basic” is as rare as finding a flower that bloomed in a dark room.\nI recognize your fragrance, hol’ up, you ain’t never gotta say shit, uh\nAnd I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh\nEverybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis\nWith poetic justice, poetic justice\nIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? But they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent Hate “But they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent” \u003e Hate Kendrick claims that he constantly receives hate from “basic” influencers who cannot understand or appreciate Kendrick’s thoughtful, complex and creative artistry. However, Kendrick doesn’t take this hate personally. From Kendrick’s perspective, “basic” influencers hate everything that Kendrick represents in contrast to the mainstream entertainment industry. The type of man that never dickride ‘cause I want a favor Dickride “The type of man that never dickride ‘cause I want a favor” \u003e Dickride Within the entertainment industry, Kendrick sees himself as representing the kind of man who never “dickrides.” In slange usage, “dickriding” refers to the act of saying an excessive and unwarrented amount of good thing about an important person in order to benefit by receiving favorable treatment from that important person.\nWhile the term “dickriding” is most often used metaphorically to describe someone who says an excessive amount of good things to gain favor, the most literal usage of the term refers to a man or woman who willingly receives anal or vaginal sexual penetration from a powerful man in order to receive favorable treatment or economic opportunities.\nIt is notable that in the viral Club Shay Shay interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00) Katt Williams highlighted how from the start of his career in the entertainment industry his entire goal was to become successful without ever literally or metaphorically riding anyone’s dick.\nMy goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked a penis. That was my only goal.\n…\nI’ve had to turn down $50 million four times - four times - just to protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about, right. Cause P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, “No.” You’ve got to tell him, “No.” I did. The man that resides in patience Patience “The man that resides in patience” \u003e Patience While “dickriding” can be a quick way to achieve some level of success, Kendrick seems to see himself as someone who has the patitence needed to reap the rewards hard-earned success. So where the soldiers at—\nthe one's that lost it all and learned to learn from that— Soldiers who learned from a loss “So where the soldiers at…lost it all and learned to learn from that?” \u003e Soldiers who learned from a loss In contrast to men who “dickride” and are “with the basic shit”, Kendrick seems to be highlighting the kinds of rare character traits and behaviors that he wants his people to nurture, particularly self improvement, education, hard work, financial stability and a desire or thirst for things that will lead to life.\nThese are traits and behaviors that often best developed during childhood and adolescence and thus would be at risk if rappers, infuencers or members of the entertainment industry are allowed to “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”.\nMore specifically, Kendrick is looking for the rare men who have the mentality of soldiers who lost everything in battle but found a way to learn invaluable life lessons from those losses.\nWithin the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick could be looking to recruit these soldiers to be his executioners.\nOn “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick mentioned that the ability to learn from a loss is something that he did not receive from how his own father parented him but it is a blessing that Kendrick want his loved ones to receive\nDaddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don’t take those well\n-“Father Time”\nI bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive\nI bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal\nI bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact\nA patient life, flaws, bless ’em twice, and they’ll bless you back\n-“Purple Hearts” a thirst for life, head inside a book\n‘cause he concerned with that— Thirst “a thirst for life, head inside a book ‘cause he concerned with that” \u003e Thirst Thirst is a concept that Kendrick mentioned on the latter half of the pivotal track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from good kid, m.A.A.d city. On that track, Kendrick described how a life of gluttony led to them to be overcome by a deep spiritual thirst.\nHow many sins, oh? I’m runnin’ out, oh\nHow many sins, oh? I lost count\nDreams of ballin’ like Spalding\nBut only shotty bounce, oh\nThe reaper callin’, oh, I’m cottonmouth, oh\nMoney is power (Money is power)\nYours is ours (Yours is ours)\nLay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh\nHope we get rich, oh, hope we can tower\nOver the city with vanity with the music louder, oh\n…\nToo many sins, oh, I’m runnin’ out, oh\nSomebody send me a well for the drought, oh\nSee all I know, oh, is takin’ notes\nOn takin’ this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh\nMy best days, oh, I stress days\n(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)\nMy best days, oh, I stress days, oh\nSay “fuck the world”, oh, my sex slave, oh\nMoney, pussy, and greed—what’s my next crave?\nWhatever it is, know it’s my next grave, oh\nTired of runnin’, tired of runnin’, tired of tumblin’\nTired of runnin’, oh, tired of tumblin’, backwards\nMy momma say “See, a pastor give me a promise\nWhat if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?\nThe truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest\nYou dyin’ of thirst, you dyin’ of thirst\nSo hop in that water, and pray that it works.\nOn the track “LUST.” from DAMN., Kendrick seems to allude to the experience of “daying of thirst” as he reveals the demonic influence that driving people towards greed, conspicuous consumption, and need for “holy water”.\nI need some water\nSomething came over me\nWay too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat During a skit at the end of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”, an older Christian woman sees that Kendrick and his friends were “dying of thirst” because their sadness and anger was driving them towards killing their enemies and putting their own lives at risk. She tells them that their thirst for blood and violence was really a spiritual thirst could only be satisfied by “holy water”, being baptized by the Spirit of the Lord, and receiving a new kind of life from Jesus.\nYoung man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?\nI know that’s not what I think that is\nWhy are you so angry?\nSee, you young men are dying of thirst\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means you need water, holy water\nYou need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord\nDo you want to receive God as your personal savior?\nOkay, repeat after me:\n“Lord God, I come to You a sinner”\n“And I humbly repent for my sins”\n“I believe that Jesus is Lord”\n“I believe You raised Him from the dead”\n“I would ask that Jesus come into my life”\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus\nFor saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life. The older Christian woman’s conclusion that Kendrick and his homies are dying of thirst and need holy water seems to come from scene in St. John’s account of the Gospel. In that scene, Jesus stopped to rest in a village inhabitted by people from ethnic group called Samaritans, who were enemies of the the Judean ethnic group to which Jesus belonged. Instead of calling down fire from heaven to burn up the Samaritan village, Jesus started a conversation with a Samaritan woman who was drawing water from a well. Jesus told the woman that he could give her “living water” which would satisfy her to the extent that she would never thirst again.\nJesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.\nSo the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Judean, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans).\nJesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”\nShe said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”\n-John 4:5,7-14 Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, as Jesus repeated his offer of “living water” to a crowd of people at a holiday feast, St. John explained that the “living water” which Jesus spoke about was actually the “Holy Spirit”. Jesus would give the “Holy Spirit” to his disciples so that his disciples would be filled with new patterns of thoughts and emotions that would empower them to live a new kind of life.\nNow on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”\nThis He said in reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive.\n-John 7:37-39\nIn St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus told the sister of Jesus’s dead friend that “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See John 11:1-45).\nIn that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, “I am the way, the truth and the life” (See John 14:2-6) When applied to this line on “Watch the Party Die”, the belief that Jesus is “the life” and the giver of “living water” implies that a “thirst for life” is truly a “thirst for Jesus”. Moreover, those who “thirst for life” discover that Jesus will satisfy their deepest thirst when they read the stories about Jesus in the “Good Book”, aka the Holy Bible.\ninformation that'll change his life\nbecause he yearns for that—\ndedication, findin' out what's right ‘cause he can earn from that? Finding out what’s right “findin’ out what’s right ‘cause he can earn from that?” \u003e Finding out what’s right Kendrick seems to highlight the virtue of individuals who know that they will earn a reward when they do the right thing, which motivates them to read books and get information that will allow them to find out what is right. These individuals stand in contrast to people who “dickride” because they want a favor. I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd shit\nCan't blame them, today they ain't really got much to work with\nHow many bitches harder than a lot of you niggas? Would trade all of y’all for Nip, I can’t be proud of you niggas Clowns and nerds “I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd shit” \u003e Clowns and nerds Kendrick seems to be asserting that the vast majority of men currently have not developed the kind of virtuous traits that behaviors that Kendrick described in the previous lines. As a result, most women who are looking for respectable partners have to put up with immature and soft clowns and nerds who do not know how to behave like real men. Nipsey Hussle “Would trade all of y’all for Nip, I can’t be proud of you niggas” \u003e Nipsey Hussle In contrast to rappers who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”, Kendrick expresses his sadness at the loss of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved South Central rapper who was murdered in March of 2019. Nipsey’s murder was particularly tragic because Nispey had shown a remarkable commitment, vision, ingenuity, entreprenership, business accumen and diplomacy in his efforts to improve his local community.\nNipsey started a community co-working space named Vector 90 which provided opportunities for Black youth in Crenshaw to take science, technology, engineering and math courses and develop as entrepreneurs.\nNipsey was closely involved in the planning and advisory stages of an open air museum called Destination Crenshaw which planned to showcase the history and culture of Black people in his neighborhood.\nNipsey arranged meetings between the Los Angeles Police Department to discuss ways to stop gang violence.\nAfter Nipsey’s death, former president Barack Obama wrote a tribute which said:\nWhile most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it – to build a skills training center and a coworking space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow – is a legacy worthy of celebration. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it. [Chorus] God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace Kendrick’s prayers “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e Kendrick’s prayers In contrast to the verses of “Watch the Party Die”, which seem to be persuasive rhetoric addressed to those who will support Kendrick’s campaign of vigilante executions, the chorus seems to be a prayer that is addressed to God.\nThe idea of praying to God is a recurring motif in Kendrick’s work going all the way back to the track “Faith” on Kendrick’s first project under the name Kendrick Lamar, the 2009 Kendrick Lamar EP.\nI found myself losing focus at a Sunday service\nEmbarrassed so I start questioning God, “What is my purpose?”\nHe said to live the way he did, that’s all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian\nAnd this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man, I can’t help but give in In 2012, Kendrick used his major label debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city to tell the backstory of how he first became a Christian. The album’s first track, “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter”, begins with Kendrick and his homies saying a version of the “Sinners Prayer” to receive Jesus as there “personal savior”. This prayer is later heard within the narrative context during the pivotal moment in “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” when an older Christian woman approachs Kendrick and his homies and implores them to start a new way of life after Kendrick’s friend Dave died in a gang shootout.\nYoung man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?\nI know that’s not what I think that is\nWhy are you so angry?\nSee, you young men are dying of thirst\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means you need water, holy water\nYou need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord\nDo you want to receive God as your personal savior?\nOkay, repeat after me:\n“Lord God, I come to You a sinner”\n“And I humbly repent for my sins”\n“I believe that Jesus is Lord”\n“I believe You raised Him from the dead”\n“I would ask that Jesus come into my life”\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”*\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life*. On Kendrick’s second major label album, To Pimp a Butterfly, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of Lucy (aka Lucifer / the devil / the satan / the false accuser / the diabolical one). Lucy acknowledges that Lucy heard Kendrick saying the “Sinner’s Prayer” to God the Father on good kid, m.A.A.d city, but was nonetheless confident that Kendrick would abandon God and pursue Lucy.\nYou said Sherane ain’t got nothing on Lucy\n…\nKendrick, Lucy don’t slack a minute, Lucy work harder\nLucy gon’ call you even when Lucy know you love your Father\nI’m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly\nLucy don’t mind, ‘cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me On Kendrick’s third major label album, DAMN., Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) repeatedly expressed feelings of sadness and frustration because he felt that nobody was praying for him. Then during the album’s pibotal track, “FEAR.”, Kendrick’s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail explaining that Kendrick’s feelings of sadness and frustration were not due to a lack of people praying for him but were instead do to Kendrick’s own lack of faithfulness in following the Lord’s commandments.\nNew Kung Fu Kenny\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\n…\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n-“ELEMENT.” Shit, I feel like—\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’\n…\nI feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me?*\n-“FEEL.” Nobody pray for me\nIt been that day for me\n-“HUMBLE.” What’s up, family?\nYeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man\nI know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately\nAnd I know you feel like, you know\nPeople ain’t been prayin’ for you\nBut you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people.\nDeuteronomy 28:28 says,\n“The Lord shall smite thee with madness\nAnd blindness, and astonishment of heart”\nSee, family, that’s why you feel like you feel\nLike you got a chip on your shoulder\nUntil you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\n-“FEAR.” On Kendrick’s fourth major label album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick seemed to depict himself as being—at least temporarily—distant from God and detached from his identity as a Christian while exploring alternative spiritual practices including praying to flowers and trees.\nYesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees\nGratification to the powers that be\n…\nThe noble person that goes to work and pray like they ‘posed to\nSlaughter people too*, your murder’s just a bit slower*\n-“Worldwide Steppers” Where’s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today\nI transformed, prayin’ to the trees, God is taking shape\n…\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract On Kendrick’s first battle track, “euphoria”, Kendrick implied that Drake was an absentee father while rapping about the role as a father, including responsibility of teaching one’s son to pray.\nWhy would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y’all think all my life is rap?\nThat’s ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that\nWakin’ him up, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nThen tell him to pray, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nThen givin’ him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin’ ‘bout that\nTeachin’ him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that\nSpeakin’ the truth and consider what God’s considerin’, you don’t know nothin’ ‘bout that On Kendrick’s second battle record, “6:16 in LA”, Kendrick spoke directly to God while seemingly confessing that he was engaging in the battle with Drake in part because his identity is wrapped up in being a solider who needs to go to war in order to have a stable identity.\nWho could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom\nGod, ah, my confession is yours\nBut, who am I if I don’t go to war? The Lord’s Prayer “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e The Lord’s Prayer The idea of a perosn praying for God to give them what they truly need is one of the central points of the most famous and univeral Christian prayer, which is known as the “Lord’s Prayer”. Thos who pray the Lord’s Prayer asks for God the Father to give them their “daily bread” in referrence to the essential physical and spiritual need on a daily basis in order to live.\nOur Father, who is in heaven,\nhallowed be Your name.\nYour Kingdom come.\nYour will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread,\nand forgive us our tresspasses,\nas we forgive those who trespass against us,\nand lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one. The idea of “bread” being symbolic for the things that someone needs to live is further explored in a story where Jesus multiplies five loves of bread in order to feed five thousand men and their families (See Matthew 14:13-21 or John 6:1-15).\nLater, after a crowd of those who ate the multiplied bread started to focus exclusively on their desire for Jesus to fulfill their physical hunger for physical bread, Jesus told the crowd that he himself is the spiritual “bread of life” and that anyone who eats Jesus as the “bread of life” will live forever.\nJesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.\n-Matthew 6:35,40,48-58 Later, just before Jesus was arrrested and executed on a cross, he shared a meal of bread and wine his disciples and told them that the bread was his body and the wine was his blood. This particular meal of Jesus’s disciplles eating bread as Jesus’s body and drinking wine as Jesus’s blood became a the most central Christian spiritual practice known as the “communion”, the “Eucharist” or the “Lord’s Supper”.\nJesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” nd when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the [covenant / agreement], which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. Hence, if we see Kendrick’s prayer during the chorus of “Watch the Party Die” as an echo of the Lord’s Prayer, we could conclude that what Kendrick truly needs to receive is Jesus himself and the new way of life that comes from living in close communion with Jesus. This is the same conclusion that was presented to Kendrick when the older Christian woman convinced Kendrick and his homies not to kill their enemies and instead led them to say the “Sinner’s Prayer” at the end of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.”\n”I would ask that Jesus come into my life\"\n“And be my Lord and Savior”\n“I receive Jesus to take control of my life”\n“And that I may live for Him from this day forward”\n“Thank you, Lord Jesus for saving me with Your precious blood”\n“In Jesus’ name, amen”\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life, your REAL life. God-given life “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e God-given life In addition to referring to himself as the “bread of life”, Jesus also describes himself as “the life” on a few other occasions in St. John’s account of the Gospel.\nAfter one of Jesus’s friends died, Jesus told the sister of the friend, “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See John 11:1-45).\nIn that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, “I am the way, the truth and the life” (See John 14:2-6) Throughout St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus repeatedly teaches that he came to earth not to kill or destroy humans but to give “eternal life” to all those who would listen to his teaching and believed in him.\nThe Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.\n-John 3:14-17\nThe one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life.\n-John 3:36\nJesus answered and said to the Samaritan woman, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”\n-John 4:13-14\nThe one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life.*\n-John 4:36\nTruly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\n-John 5:24\nYou examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.\n-John 5:39-40\n*Do not work for the food that perishes, but *work for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.\n-John 6:27\nFor this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.\n-John 6:40\nTruly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.\n-John 6:47-51\nTruly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\n-John 6:53-54\nMy sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.\n-John 10:27-28\nThe one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.\n-John 12:25\nThe Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life.\n-John 12:49-50 All of these teachings about “eternal life” lead up to a culminating prayer in which Jesus talks directly to God the Father and declares that “eternal life” is the experience of knowing God the Father and Jesus as the Son of God in a close relationship.\nJesus spoke these things; and raising His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, so that the Son may glorify You, just as You gave Him authority over all humanity, so that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life. this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.\n-John 17:1-3 Hence, when Kendrick prays “God, give me life”, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is life. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about love and forgivness so that Kendrick can judge and execute the very same people who Jesus came to offer eternal life.\nGod-given peace “God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace” \u003e God-given peace Just before he was arrested and executed, Jesus gave one final teaching to his disciples. In that final teaching, Jesus said that he was giving “peace” to his disciples. Moreover, Jesus clarified that that he himself is the peace that he was giving to his disciples. The disciples would receive this peace by listening to Jesus’ words and remaining in close relationship with Jesus.\nPeace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression, but be of good courage for I have overcome the world.\n-John 14:27, 16:33 Also, in Jesus’s most famous collection of teachings, he declared that his disciples will be blessed with a close relationship to God the Father when they serve as peacemakers in the world.\nBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. -Matthew 5:9 Hence, when Kendrick prays “dear God, please give me peace”, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is peace. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about being a peacemaker so that Kendrick can try to overcome the evils of the world through violence.\nDear God, please keep these lame niggas away from me Keep away from me “Dear God, please keep these lame niggas away from me’” \u003e Keep away from me In slang, the word “lame” refers to anything that is not cool, refined or worthy of honor.\nKendrick’s prayer to keep “these lame niggas away” seems to echo the end of the Lord’s Prayer which asks God the Father to lead his people away from tempting situations and away from the “evil one” in reference to the [devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one].\nLead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. By praying to “keep these lame niggas away from me” Kendrick seems to be asserting that these “lame niggas” members of “the other side” which is opposed to “God’s side”. If Kendrick was to follow the example of Jesus and the early praying to transform these “lame niggas” so that they could repent, apologize and come to “God’s side”.\nDear God, keep me shinin' Shining “Dear God, keep me shinin’” \u003e Shining In hip hop terminology, “shining” refers to wearing gaudy amounts of expensive, shiny diamond jewelry or otherwise making public displays of one’s success, wealth and power.\nGiven that Kendrick earlier expressed his desire to kill rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”, it is likely that Kendrick is not asking God to give him shiny jewelry.\nSimilar to the previous requests for life and peace, it seems more likely that Kendrick is making a request for spiritual well-being rather than material or financial well-being.\nIn biblical terminology “shining” refers to the way in which people who follow God’s commandments serve as bright example of how other humans should live.\nIn the introduction to St. John’s account of the Gospel, St. John introduces Jesus by saying that Jesus is the “true light” who has existed even before the universe was created. Moreover, St. John asserts through Jesus’s birth as a human, the “light” has now come down from the skies to “shine” on humans and penetrate through the darkness of human wickedness.\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome it…the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world Later in St. John’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a crowd of listeners that he is the “light of the world” that humans can follow so that they find the light of life and no longer walk towards the darkness of death.\nThen Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”\n-John 8:12 In addition to identifying himself as the “light of the word”, in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus also taught his disciples that they are the “light of the world” who are meant to “shine” the light of Jesus’s way of life so that people in the world no longer have to walk towards the darkness of death.\nYou all are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bucket, but on a lampstand; so it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before humans, so that they may see your good actions and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\n-Matthew 6:14-16 By teaching that humans who are faithful to God will shine spiritual light to indicate how other humans should live, Jesus seems to be referring to a Old Testament prophesy from the Prophet Daniel.\nMany of those who sleep (i.e. are dead) in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt. Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the sky. Those who turn many toward right relationship will shine as the stars forever and ever.\n-Daniel 12:2-3 Hence, by praying “Dear God, keep me shinin’”, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is light. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus’s teachings about being a “light to the world” by being an example to those who are living in darkness and giving them an opportunity to turn towards right relationships with other humans. Rather than turning wicked people toward the light of life, Kendrick keeps expressing his desire to bring the darkness of death upon the hosts and attendees of the party.\nThe fuck do they really think?\nPocket-watching, you must be the police. Police “Pocket-watching, you must be the police” \u003e Police Kendrick’s prayer to God seems to be interrupted as he wonders what the “lame niggas\" who thinking about Kendrick. Kendrick seems to conclude that that the “lame niggas” are thinking that Kendrick is acting like a police officer who is “pocket-watching” them.\n“Pocket-watching” refers to the act of closely monitoring what another person is doing—particularly regarding their use of money—so that monitoring person can make some kind of judgement or assessment of the other person.\nWithin hip hop culture, rappers, hustlers and “steet niggas” often describe an adversarial relationship with the police, most famously on the legendary rap group NWA’s hit single “Fuck tha Police.”\nBy saying that Kendrick “must be the police”, the “lame niggas” seem to be expressing some amount of nervousness that they might be caught, prosecuted, and judged for any illicit actions that they might have committed at “the party”.\nThe idea that Kendrick “must be the police” would also align with the battle track “meet the grahams”, where Kendrick claimed to be “policing” the “weird shit” going on in the entertainment industry after he dropped the bombshell allegation that Drake and his OVO crew have allegedly been sex trafficking under aged girls.\nSandra, sit down, what I’m about to say is heavy, now listen\nMm-mm, your son’s a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualizes ’em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein’ a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin’ his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin’ there’s predators like him lurkin’\nFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose\nI been in this industry twelve years, I’ma tell y’all one lil’ secret\nIt’s some weird shit goin’ on and some of these artists be here to police it*\nThey be streamlinin’ victims all inside of they home and callin’ ’em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas* God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think Bless “God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think” \u003e Bless After wondering what the “lame niggas” were thinking about him, Kendrick goes back to praying to God. He now asks for God to “bless” the words that he is rapping and the words that he is thinking.\nIn biblical terminology a “blessing” refers to God giving preferential favor to a people, places, objects or things so that they may bring about more life and goodness on the earth.\nIn the very first narrative of the Bible, God gave a blessing to animals and then humans so that they would reproduce new life that fill the earth.\nGod created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”\nGod created humanity in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” -Genesis 1:21-23,27-28 However, when humans are tempted by a devil in the form of a snake and disobey God’s commandment by trying to define good and evil for themselves, their actions result in curse which leads to death and evil on the earth.\nThen the LORD God said to the snake,\n“Because you have done this,\nCursed are you more than all the livestock,\nAnd more than any animal of the field;\nOn your belly you shall go,\nAnd you shall eat dust\nAll the days of your life;\nThen the LORD God said to the human, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’:\nCursed is the ground because of you;\nWith hard labor you shall eat from it\nAll the days of your life.\nIt will grow both thorns and thistles for you;\nYet you shall eat the plants of the field;\nBy the sweat of your face\nYou shall eat bread,\nUntil you return to the ground,\nBecause from it you were taken;\nFor you are dust,\nAnd to dust you shall return.” -Genesis 3:14,17-19 The story of humanity receiving a blessing or a curse depending on whether they obey or disobey God’s commandments is a recurring biblical motif that gets further developed in the Book of Deuteronomy when the Prophet Moses gives a speech to the Israelites before they go into the “Promised Land” which God had prepared for them. Moses repeatedly told the Israelites that God was offering them a choice between life and death, between a blessing and a curse.\nIf you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I am commanding you today, that the Lord your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God: Blessed will you be in the city, and blessed will you be in the country.\nBlessed will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock.\nBlessed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\nBlessed will you be when you come in, and blessed will you be when you go out.\nBut it shall come about, if you do not obey the Lord your God, to be careful to follow all His commandments and His rules which I am commanding you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you.\nCursed will you be in the city, and cursed will you be in the country.\nCursed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\nCursed will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, the newborn of your herd, and the offspring of your flock.\nCursed will you be when you come in, and cursed will you be when you go out.\nThe LORD shall smite you with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.\nI have placed before you today life and good and also death and evil. For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his rules, and his justice, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you. I have placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed, to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days.\n-Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19,28 30:15-16,19-20 In the New Testament, Jesus and his chosen disciples commanded followers of Jesus love and bless their enemies and not to hate and curse them.\nJesus taught them saying, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n-Matthew 5:43-45 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.\n-St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans 12:14 Given that throughout the verses of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick has used his words to call for the execution of the hosts and attendees of “the party” and has been ignoring Jesus’s commandments to love his enemies and bless those who have persecuted him, it is ironic that Kendrick is now praying for God to “bless his words” and “bless how he think.”\nDAMN. “God, bless these words. Dear God, bless how I think” \u003e DAMN. It is notable that the title for Kendrick’s album, DAMN., is shortening of the word “damnation” which is a synonym for “curse.” and the oppostive of a “blessing”.\n“BLOOD.” the first track on DAMN. opens a voice that presents a choice between life and death, similar to the choice that the Prophet Moses placed in front of the Israelites.\nIs it wickedness?\nIs it weakness?\nYou decide.\nAre we gonna live or die? On “YAH.” the third track on DAMN., Kendrick identifies himself as an Israelite and refers to a conversation in which his cousin Carl Duckworth told him that he was “cursed” based on Moses’s speech from Deuteronomy about blessings and curses.\nI’m a Israelite, don’t call me black no mo’\nThat word is only a color, it ain’t facts no mo’\nMy cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth\nSaid know my worth\nAnd Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed On “FEAR.” the pivotal track on DAMN., we hear a voicemail in which Kendrick’s cousin Carl Duckworth quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and asserts that Kendrick is experiencing a cursed existence because he has not been following God’s commandments.\nWhat’s up, family?\nYeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man\nI know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately\nAnd I know you feel like, you know\nPeople ain’t been prayin’ for you\nBut you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people\nDeuteronomy 28:28 says,\n“The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart”\nSee, family, that’s why you feel like you feel\nLike you got a chip on your shoulder\nUntil you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\n…\nVerse 2 says,\n“You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,\ntherefore I will punish you for all your iniquities”\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He’s gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe’s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He’s gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that’s why we get chastised\nThat’s why we’re in the position that we’re in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me Drawing the line in the Old Testament “Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me” \u003e Drawing the line in the Old Testament Kendrick seems to be asking God to make a distinction between himself and the “lame niggas\" who Kendrick wants God to keep away from him.\nKendrick seems to be requesting something that is similar to what God did when he rescured the Israelites from slavery.\nPrior to being resuced the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptian Pharaoh, who forced the Israelites to live in slave houses in a region near the capital of Egypt. When Pharaoah worried that the Israelite population was becoming too large, Pharaoh sent orders for soldier to kill every baby boy that was born to an Israelite mother.\nGod saved one Israelite boy named Moses and later called Moses to be a prophet. God then sent Moses to confront Pharaoh by telling him to let the Israelites go free. When Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God used Moses to send plagues ten different plagues which brough death and destruction upon Egypt.\nAfter the first nine plagues, God said that he was going to send a final tenth plague in which a spirit of death would pass through the capital of Egypt and the neighboring regions. This spirit of death would kill the first born sons and male animals of every household as a punishment for Pharaoh and the Egyptians killing the Israelties newborn sons.\nSince this plague of death was going to pass through the region of the Israelite slave houses, God told the Israelites that their sons and male animals would be spared for each Israelite houshold that celebrated a Passover (aka Pesach / Pascha) ritual meal. During the Passover meal, each Israelite family would kill a lamb, smear the blood on the posts and crossbar of their exterior door, and eat the lamb meat with unleavened bread. When the death spirit came across a door covered in lamb’s blood it would “pass over” the house without killing the firstborn son or male animals.\nGod told Moses that by bringing death to the firstborn sons of Egypt while providing a way preserve the lives of the sons of Israel, God was created a line of separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites.\nThere will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. But against any of the children of Israel a dog won’t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, *that you may know that the LORD makes a line of separation between the Egyptians and Israel.\n-Exodus 11:6-7 Hence, by praying “Dear God, draw the line” and prevent anyone from confusing Kendrick with the “lame niggas”, Kendrick seems to be asking God to kill the “lame niggas\" similar to how God sent the spirit of death to killsthe sons of the Egyptian who liked taking the innocent lives of the Israelites in the Old Testament.\nDrawing the line in the New Testament “Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse ’em with me” \u003e Drawing the line in the New Testament In the New Testament, the are several instances where Jesus does speak a future day where he will separate the righteous from the wicked.\nIn St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about a land owner who instructs his servants to plant wheat seeds in a field. However, after the servants plant the wheat seeds, a deceptive adversary—who represents the [devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one]—comes at night to plant seeds which will grow into weeds that look like wheat but do not produce any grain (See Matthew 13:24-30,36-43).\nWhen the wheat and the weeds begin to sprout up, the servants discover that someone has planted weeds among the wheat. The servants initially want to pull out all the weeds from the field. However, the land owner stops them.\nThe land owner tells the servants that because the wheat and the weeds look very similar at this stage of their development, if the servants try to pull up the weeds they may accidentally pull up some of the wheat thinking that they are weeds. Moreover, since the wheat and the weeds are planted so close together, even if they can accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds, pulling up the weeds may uproot the wheat.\nThe land owner tells the servants that it is not yet time to pull up the weeds. Instead, the land owner tells the servants to wait until the time of the harvest when all of the wehat has had the chance to be fruitful and produce grain. At that point, the servants will be able to accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds. The servants will then gather the wheat together and burn up the weeds to dispose of them.\nJesus explains that this parable is a metaphor for the “Last Judgment” at end of the world as we know it, when those who have lived lives with right relationships will be gathered together in God’s new creation while the wicked are exclused from God’s new creation. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick seems to be a kind of disobedient servant who refuses to listen to the land owner’s instructions and is convinced that now is the time to pull out the weeds. If he continues to disobey the land owenrs instruction, Kendrick will end up destroying the lives of the those who will eventually produce good grain.\nIt is particularly ironic that in the first verse Kendrick described himself as a “the man that resides in patience” but by saying “I think it’s time to watch the party die” Kendrick seems to be too impatient to wait for the time that the Lord has set to bring an end to wickedness.\nLater in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells another parable about the “Last Judgement” in which the Lord will be like a herder who takes a mixed herd of sheep and goats into the pastures. However, at the end of the day, the herder separates the sheep from the goats and places the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.\nJesus explains that the sheep represent people who have maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need. In contrast, the goats represents people who have not maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need.\nIn the parable, many of the people who turn out to be sheep are not aware that they did anything in thier lives that would cause them to be included among the sheep. Similarly, many of the people who turn out to be goats are not aware that they failed to do things that would have allowed them to be included among the sheep.\nThe fact that the identity of the sheep and the goats is a surprise that is not revealed until the end of time as we know seems to suggest that all humans should not be quick to assume that someone else is a goat or assume that they themselves are sheep. Within the context of “Watch the Party Die”, seems to be convinced that he is one of the sheep. However, by advocating to burn down entire villages and ignoring Jesus’s commandments to love his neighbor, Kendrick is acting more like a goat who has failed to maintain right relationships.\nDear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried Forgiveness in the New Testament “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness in the New Testament Kendrick’s final request is for God to grant him forgiveness. In case God might not be included to forgive kendrick, Kendrick tried to justify himself by pointing out how hard he has tried to do what’s right.\nThe request for God’s forgviness echos the Lord’s Prayer, which includes the following request:\nForgive us our transgressions (i.e. violations of trust)\nas we forgive those who transgress against us (i.e. violate our trust) After teaching his disciples the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus specifically highlighted the request for forgiveness by making it clear that God would not forgive those who refuse to forgive others.\nIf you forgive humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], your Father will also not forgive your [transgressions / violations of trust].\n-Matthew 6:14-15 Later on in St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel, one of Jesus’s disciples asked how many times he should forgive a brother who has sdone something wrong to him. In response, Jesus told his disciples a parable which reflected on the for necessity for God’s people to forgive other humans because God has already forgiven his people to a much greater degree (See Matthew 18:21-35).\nIn this parable there is a king—representing God the Father—who has many servants—representing different humans, particularly followers of Jesus.\nOne of these servants has somehow borrowed large amounts of money from the king and now owes the king what in today’s currency would be equivalent to $8 billion dollars.\nWhen the king realizes how much money the servant owes him, the king announced plans to sell the servant into slavery along with the servant’s wife and children in order to at least recuperate some money.\nThe servant then falls on the ground and begs the king not to sell him into slavery. He even tells the king that he will repay the equivalent of $8 billion dollar that he owes.\nThe king has compassion on the servant, releases him from his impending slavery and forgives all of the servants debts.\nHowever, immediately after having his debts forgiven, the first servant walks out of kings court and sees a second servant who owes the first servant what would be the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars.\nThe first servant immedateily grabs the second servant by the neck, begins choking him and demands that the second servant pay him back.\nThe second servant then falls on the ground and begs the first servant servant to be patient and he will repay the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars that he owes.\nHowever, the first servant refuses to forgive the second servant. Instead, the first servant throws the second servant into a debtors prison where the second servant will be forced for work for three or more months in order to pay the first servant back.\nSoon the king finds out what the first servant did to the second servant and calls the first servant back to his court. The king becomes angry with the first servant and strongly condemns him for refusing to forgive a $14 thousand dollar debt after the king had forgiven him much, much larger $8 billion dollar debt.\nThe king then once again holds the first servant responsible for the $8 billion dollar debt. The king orders the first servant to be thrown into debtors prison until he has repaid the entire debt. This punishment is essentially a life sentence because it would take 164 thousand years of labor for the first servant to pay the king back. Based on the Jesus’s teaching on the Lord’s Prayer and the parable of the unforgiving servant, it is deeply ironic that Kendrick is praying “Dear God, please forgive me” after he has refused to forgive Drake or anyone who has participated in “the party” and has even claimed “this shit done got too wicked to apologize.”\nMoreover, based on Jesus’s teaching, Kendrick’s self-justification that God knows “how hard I tried” seems destined to fall on deaf ears and be rejected by God. Jesus dicussed how he would reject the pleas of individuls who claimed to do lots of things for God but refused to actually does God the Father.\nJesus taught his disciple saying, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day,\n‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’\nAnd then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; leave Me, you who act against the law.’”\n-Matthew 7:21-23 Forgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge. The need forgivness is a central theme within both DAMN. and Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers.\nOn “DNA.”, the second track of DAMN., Kendrick rapped about the fact his rough upbringing taught him so many things he needed to know to become successful in the would, but the one things that he wish he had received was to be nurtured in a way that would allow him to forgive others.\nI know murder, conviction\nBurners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption\nScholars, fathers dead with kids and\nI wish I was fed forgiveness\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA The theme of monetary debts in the parable of the unforgiving servant also reminds us of the track “XXX.” from DAMN., where Kendrick tells a story about his friend’s son who was killed because of “insufficient funds”. When the friend called Kendrick and asked for spiritual guidance from an anointed Chrisitan, Kendrick ignores Jesus’s teachings by saying that he would never forgive someone who harmed any one of his family members and the friend should not forgive either.\nYesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101\nSaid they killed his only son because of insufficient funds\n…\nHe said, “K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me\nI know that you anointed, show me how to overcome”\nHe was lookin’ for some closure, hopin’ I could bring him closer\nTo the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him\n“I can’t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel\nIf somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin’ killed\nTell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of\nAll the memories collected, moments you could never touch\nI wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\n…\nLet somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman\nTouch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother\nYou should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap In the first verse of “Mother I Sober” from Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Kendrick acknowledged his battles with sex addiction, infidelity, and violations of trust in his relationships with Whitney, his fiance and the mother of his children. As he reckoned with the pain that he had caused to an innocent soul, Kendrick asked God whether he could be forgiven for what he had done.\nIntoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy The theme of forgivness is noticably been absent within the diss tracks that Kendrick released during his battle with Drake. Here in “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick seems to fully reject the idea of forgiving anyone even as he prays for God to forgive him.\nForgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge “Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin’ how hard I tried” \u003e Forgiveness in Kendrick’s cataloge. I do think it is important to point out that within the context of Bible, forgiveness does not mean that society, law enforcement or victims should allow a crime to go unpunished or—even worse—allow a perpetrator to continue harming the victim or other future victims.\nThis point is actually illustrated quite clearly by the Old Testament story of King David using his power to traffic a woman to his palace, force her to have sex with him, and then kill her husband to cover up a pregnancy. In that case, God sent a prophet to directly confront David about his evil and unjust actions. David admitted to being guilty under God’s judgment, repented, was forgiven by God, and was spared from the death penalty. However, David’s actions had real world consequences that led to the deaths of at least three of David’s sons as well as a significant amount of societal shame which over time made countless numbers of men in David’s time—along with later readers of the Bible—think twice about allowing uncontrolled sexual desire to lead them to coercing women or murdering people to cover up earlier acts of wickedness.\nOne can also look at the New Testament story from St. John account of the Gospel in which a woman who was caught while she was having sex in an adulterous relationship. Unlike the case of the woman with King David, she had apparently chosen to engage in this sexual relationship. She was then brought in front of an all-male court of Judean religious leaders who appealed to Jesus to serve as a trial judge who would sentence her to death under the rules laid out in laws given to Moses (See John 8:1-11).\nJesus sent all the accusers away by pointing out that they had themselves done things against the law of Moses that the Israelites were supposed to follow and thus should not feel that it was their right to condemn the woman to the death penalty.\nJesus had not done any actions that broke the law of Moses, so he theoretically had the right to condemn the woman to the death penalty. However, he chose not to. Instead, Jesus told the woman, “I do not condemn you. Go on your way. From now on, do not sin any more.”\nIn this case, Jesus let the woman go free without any additional punishment beyond the societal shame that she had already experienced and would likely continue to experience. Jesus didn’t totally take this consequence away, though he did mitigate it to some degree by pointing out the lawless actions of her accusers.\nMoreover, Jesus warned her by saying “do not sin any more”. This statement echos a previous statement from Jesus after Jesus healed a man and told that man “Now you have become well. Do not sin anymore or something worse will happen to you”.\nHence, Jesus ultimate goal was for the woman not be immediatly killed for her wickedness but for her to find healing and be transformed in a way that she would be able to stop herself from acting in a way that would ruin her relationships and result in a negative final judgement at the end of time. I think it's time for me to watch the party die\nGet 'em gone, we gon' watch the party die Send ’em home, we gon’ watch the party die Die “I think it’s time…Get ’em gone…Send ’em home” \u003e Watch the party die After praying to God throughout most of the chorus, Kendrick ends the chorus by doubling down on the first line of the first verse. Kendrick further emphasizes his desire to execute the hosts and attendees of the party by saying “watch the party die” three times and adding the phrases “send ’em home” and “get’em gone”, which are both slang phrases for killing someone. [Verse 2] I think it’s time to watch the party die Repeated “I think it’s time to watch the party die” \u003e Repeated Kendrick begins the second verse with the same line from beginning of the first verse. Additionally, the chorus ended with Kendrick saying “watch the party die” three times. By continuing to repeat this phrase, Kendrick seems to be speaking like someone with an unhealthy obsession with vigilante justice. Street niggas and the corporate guys,\nthe rappers that report the lies Street niggas “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Street niggas Kendrick seems to be highlighting more people who should be executed for the benefit of society.\n“Street niggas\" refer to young Black men who are engaged in selling drugs, hustling, robberies, gang banging or any other kind of illegal activity that is done to get money. These kinds of activities are statistically more common in densely populated, urbanized neighborhoods in major American cities where people are more likely to walk through the city on street sidewalks in contrast to American suburbs where many people exclusively drive from one place to another.\nThe illegal activities in which “street niggas” often engage often lead to violence, murder and other casualties as Kendrick has detailed throughout much of his work, such as the track “Poe Man’s Dreams” from Section.80.\nMy mama is stressin’, my daddy tired\nI need me a weapon, these niggas ride\nEvery minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me\nHow I’m gon’ listen when I don’t even hear God?\nHeaven or hell, base it all on my instincts\nMy hands dirty, you worried ‘bout mud in your sink\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with you’ll squeal with you Since “street niggas\" typically depict themselves as people who like to kill others, they would likely be included among the peaople who Kendrick planned to execute when he said “We even kill the killers ‘cause they like taking innocent lives.”\nCorporate guys “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Corporate guys “Corporate guys” likely refers to the entertainment industry’s corporate employees who are paid to find ways of making money from music, films and other forms of entertainment. In many cases, their approach to making money is not in the best interest of the artist who makes the work, the audience who consumes the work, or the society in which the work is distibuted.\nIn the case that “corporate guys” are trying to make money from the stories of “street niggas”, the resulting work may actually lead the audience to immitate behavior that leads some individuals to kill other individuals.\nWithin both DAMN. and Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick has pointed out that corporate employees often hide their tendency to be killers and murderers while teaching their own deceptive philosophies to the youth.\nIt’s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street\nCorporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with\nHomicidal thoughts\n-“XXX.”\nThe world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run\nThe prophets abandoned, the law take advantage,\nthe market is crashin’, the industry wants\nNiggas and bitches to sleep in a box\nwhile they makin’ a mockery followin’ us\nThis ain’t Monopoly, watchin’ for love.\nThis ain’t monogamy. Y’all gettin’ fucked*\n-“N95”\n*I’m a killer, he’s a killer, she’s a killer, bitch\nWe some killers, walkin’ zombies, tryna scratch that itch\n…\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology\nSilent murderer, what’s your body count? Who your sponsorship?\n-“Worldwide Steppers” “Corporate guys” may thus be complicit with those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth” and for whom “the graveyard is company”.\nRappers that report the lies “Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies” \u003e Rappers that report the lies Rather than “givin’ truth to the youth”, “corporate guys” often appropriate the stories from “street niggas” and package them in music made by “rappers that report the lies”.\nOn “N95.” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick seemed to expose liars in the rap game and demand that they take off their lies like an actor taking off a mask.\nYou’re back outside, but they still lied\n…\nTake off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi\nTake off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies\nTake off the weird-ass jewelry, I’ma take ten steps, then I’m taking off top five\nTake off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it’s a real world outside\n(Take that shit off) It’s also notable that in the battle tracks, Kendrick repeatedly called Drake a liar, actor, and manipulator who has tried to borrow stories and credibility from “street niggas”.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now is spiralin’\nYou’re movin’ just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin’ distasteful\nI calculate you’re not as calculated, I can even predict your angle\nFabricatin’ stories on the family front ‘cause you heard Mr. Morale\nA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now\nYou’re not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\n…\nKnow you a master manipulator and habitual liar too\nBut don’t tell no lie about me and I won’t tell truths ‘bout you\n…\nHow many more fairytale stories ‘bout your life ’til we had enough?\nHow many more Black features ’til you finally feel that you’re Black enough?\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n…\nI’m allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein’ famous\nYachty can’t give you no swag neither,\nI don’t give a fuck ‘bout who you hang with\n-“euphoria”\nI think somebody lying\nSmell somebody lying\nI don’t see no fire\n…\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I can see the vibes on Ak’\nEven he lookin’ compromised, let’s peel the layers back\n-“6:16 in LA”\nYou a body shamer, you gon’ hide them baby mamas, ain’t ya?\nYou embarrassed of ’em, that’s not right, that ain’t how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself\n-“meet the grahams”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 god, ayy\n…\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\n-“Not Like Us” Kendrick expressed his hatred for all street niggas, corporate guys, rappers and members of the entertainment industry who have empowered, emboldened and enabled Drake.\nWhoever that’s fuckin’ with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too I need they families mortified Families moritifed “I need they families mortified” \u003e Families mortified In addition to ordering the execution of the “street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies”, Kendrick says that he “needs” the families of these individuals to be “mortified”. The word “mortified” refers to someone feeling ashamed, particularly when they are in the view of the public.\nIt is notable that in early forms of English—from the 1300s to the 1700s—the word “moritiy” meant “to kill”. The word was originally derived from the Latin word “mortificō” which literally meant “to put to death”. In early forms of English, “mortify” was often used metaphorically to refer to the act of subduing, humbling, or humiliating someone.\nBy using the word mortify, Kendrick subtly brings up the idea that the family of the street niggas, corporate guys, and lying rappers should also be killed. The idea of killing family members of excessively wicked individuals connects back to first verse where Kendrick told his supporters to “burn the whole village”. We can do life without 'em. Get they bodies organized.\nTell me if you obliged Life goes on without them “We can do life without ’em. Get they bodies organized.” \u003e Execution orders Coming after the previous lines, Kendrick again seems to be assuring his supporters that it is okay to kill the street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies\"along with their family members because society will go on just fine without them being alive.\nKendrick then seems to appeal to his supporters to join his roster of executioners and help in the process of organizing the dead bodies after carrying out the execution orders. No more pillow-talkin', jump-startin' neighborhood wars\nDirty-mackin’ bitches because your spirit is insecure Pillow-talking “No more pillow-talkin’, jump-startin’ neighborhood wars” \u003e Pillow-talking “Pillow-talking” refers to conversations that happen between couples while lying down in bed with their heads on pillows after having sex.\nCertain hip hop media figures, such as DJ Akademics, have explained that arguments, hatred and information that is leveraged within rap battle often spreads because many rappers will often have sex with the same set of women. These women end up pillow-talking about the other rappers with whom they have had sex.\nDJ Akademics—who is sometimes referred to as Ak’—is also known for being a loyal supporter of Drake. Kendrick previously suggested that DJ Akademics is compromised on “6:16 in LA”.\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I can see the vibes on Ak’\nEven he lookin’ compromised, let’s peel the layers back The pillow-talking dynamic also exist among violent street niggas, which explains how pillow-talking could lead to neighborhood wars.\nBy saying “no more pillow-talkin’”, Kendrick seems to be implying that he will be giving orders to execute the “dirty-macking bitches” who have attended “the party” or had sex with the street niggas, corporate guys or rappers that report the lies.\nDirty-mackin’ bitches “Dirty-mackin’ bitches because your spirit is insecure” \u003e Dirty-mackin’ bitches “Macking” refers to physical contact, conversations, or other flirtatious actions that a person does to flirt or attract someone with whom the person wants to have sex.\nDirty can be used to describe something that is dishonorable or something that is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.\nHere Kendrick seems to be criticizing the “dirty ackin’” women and men whose “pillow-talking” is leading to neighborhood wars.\nKendrick seems to suggest the reason why men or women get into these “dirty-macking”, “pillow-talking” sexual relationships because they are insecure men who need the validation of an attractive woman agreeing to have sex with them or insecure women who need the validation of a famous rapper expressing a strong desire to have sex with them. The flashy nigga with nasty decisions\nusin’ money as a backbone Nasty “The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin’ money as a backbone” \u003e Nasty In slang, “flashy” is an adjective which describes someone who shows off or flaunts their wealth and possession. “Flashy niggas” might thus be included among those who “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”.\nThe idea of “dirty” from the previous line gets escalated to “nasty”, conveys a sense of repulsion or aversion. Both “dirty” and “nasty” are used as slang adjectives to describe someone who is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.\nThe words “nasty” and “dirty” are both synonyms for the word “freaky” which Kendrick used when he described Drake as a “freaky ass nigga” and a “69 god”—in reference to an adventurous form of simultaneous oral sex-on “Not Like Us.”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 god, ayy\nFreaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy\n…\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)\nHe a fan, he a fan, he a\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God\nFreaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life\nHey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life Backbone “The flashy nigga with nasty decisions usin’ money as a backbone” \u003e Backbone In English “having a backbone” is an idiom for having the courage, strength, and ability to stand up for oneself.\nKendrick’s criticism of “the flashy nigga” who is “usin’ money as a backbone” may also be applied to Drake. Within the battle, Kendrick accused Drake of acting like a tough “street nigga” even though he has no backbone and has to pass real street niggas to join his crew an be his “backbone”. However, as Kendrick pointed out, these “street niggas” who are paid to be Drake’s “backbone” are actually a liability because they are not truly loyal to Drake and are only around for the money.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now is spiralin’\n…\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n-“euphoria”.\nHave you ever thought that OVO is workin’ for me?\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\n…\nIt was fun until you started to put money in the streets\nThen lost money ‘cause they came back with no receipts\n…\nIf you were street-smart, then you woulda caught\nthat your entourage is only to hustle you\nA hundred niggas that you got on salary\nAnd twenty of ’em want you as a casualty\nAnd one of them is actually next to you\nAnd two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle\nJust don’t got the audacity to tell you\n-“6:16 in LA” Drake’s strategy of paying “street niggas” and other tough guys to be part of his crew is well documented online most notably in this video by HipHopMadness.\nI want his head cracked before he’s back home Head cracked “I want his head cracked before he’s back home” \u003e Head cracked Kendrick give even more specific instructions on how he wants the hosts and attendees of “the party” to be executed. In this case, he orders his executioners kill the condemned man by hitting him in the head with some kind of blunt weapon until the man’s skull is cracked open.\nKendrick orders for the execution to happen while the condemned man is out of his house and before the condemned man ever has a chance to come back home that day. The immediacy of these orders further highlights the idea that “it is time” to watch the party die.\nThe specificity of these execution orders resembles “XXX.” from DAMN. where Kendrick talked about how he would kill someone who had killed his son by waiting outside of the building where the killer was located and then gun the killer down at his first opportunity.\nI’d wait in front a nigga’s spot and watch him hit his block\nI’d catch a nigga leavin’ service if that’s all I got\nI’d chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap*\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”* The radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary Propaganda “The radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary” \u003e Propaganda A “radio personality” is host of an radio program, podcast or other form of audio based content who publicly broadcasts his or her perspective on current events or popular culture. Propaganda is the deliberate dissemination of information, ideas, or messages that are often biased or misleading and are designed to influence public opinion, manipulate emotions, or promote a specific agenda or ideology. Propaganda is typically disseminated by powerful or influential political entity, government, industry or group who wants to influence the public in order to control their actions or hold on to power. Kendrick implies that many of these “radio personalities” are getting paid to use their platform to disseminate propaganda on behalf of the entertainment industry or on behalf of the systems which mentally enslave Black people.\nIt is notable that on his 2016 track, “Hype”, Drake boasts about creating his own propaganda.\nI don’t take this shit for granted\nI do my own propaganda On the battle track “6:16 in LA”, Kendrick accuses Drake of “playin’ dirty with propaganda”.\nBut let me tell you some game ‘cause I can see you, my lil’ homie\nYou playin’ dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya\nYou’re playin’ nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots\nBut your reality can’t hide behind Wi-Fi\nYour lil’ memes is losin’ steam, they figured you out\nThe forced opinions is not convincin’, y’all need a new route A few months after “Watch the Party Die” was released, Kendrick released the album GNX whose opening track “wacced out murals” mentions “Watch the Party Die” and specifically criticies a White comedy podcast host who controvertially joked about Black women being emotionally disregulated and violent.\nDon’t let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that’s law\nI know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that’s close to them\nThe niggas that coon, the niggas that bein’ groomed, slide on both of them On the track “Worldwide Steppers” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick asserted that Hollywood’s corporate leaders and employees are “silent murderers” who teach their deadly and deceptive philosophies in schools.\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\nNon-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)\nHollywood corporate in school, teachin’ philosophies\nYou either gon’ be dead or in jail, killer psychology Let me know when they turn up as a casualty\nI want agony, assault, and battery Sadistic “…casualty. I want agony, assault, and battery” \u003e Sadistic In English the word “casualty” is used to refer to someone who has died—or in some cases someone who has been injured—during an act of violence such a war or a criminal attack.\nIn the most narrow legal definition, “assault” is a crime in which a someone causes reasonable fear that they will cause physical harm to another person or make unwanted physical contact with another person. Meanwhile, “battery” is a crime in which someone actually causes physical harm or makes unwanted physical contact.\nThe use of the terms “assault” and “battery” reminds us that the acts of all of these vigilante executions which Kendrick has ordered are illegal, criminal attacks.\nMoreover, by saying that he wants the hosts and attendees of “the party” to experience extreme physical and mental suffering or “agony”, Kendrick seems to not be satisfied with simply ridding society of wicked people. He seems to be expressing an unhealthy and sadistic enjoyment of knowing that wicked people will experience extreme suffering. I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people\nmakin’ humanity work New Earth in the New Testament “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Earth in the New Testament The term “New Earth” originates from, “The Revelation”, the final book in the New Testament and the Bible in which St. John sees a prophetic, visionary “Revelation” from Jesus.\nIn this prophetic vision, Jesus shows St. John how the oppression, persecution, violence and killings that Christians faced under various Roman Emperors from 64 to 100 AD are part of a much larger pattern of the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”] trying to bring death and destruction to those who follow Jesus as their Lord.\nJesus encourages various church communities to “overcome” not by starting a revolution or killing their oppressors, but by forgiving and loving the humans who are acting like enemies, but are really just under the control of the true enemy—the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].\nJesus encourages these persecuted church communities to trust that one day Jesus will defeat the true enemy. Moreover, Jesus promised that one day, God will bring an end to the world as it currently exists and bring about a “New Heaven” which fully overlaps with a “New Earth”. In this overlapping “New Heaven” and “New Earth” where all humans will know God, have a loving relationship with God, and obey God’s commandments, which will lead to an eternal life of peace, justice and right relationships.\nThis transformation from the current Earth to the “New Earth” is described in the second to last chapter of “The Revelation” where St. John describes the end of his vision by saying:\nI saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more. I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, God’s [tent / residence] is with humans, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; There will be no mourning, no crying, no pain, any more. The first things have passed away.”\n-Revelation 21:1-4 New Earth in New Age Spirituality “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Earth in New Age Spirituality More recently, biblical concept of a “New Earth” has also been encorporated into “New Age” spirituality.\n“New Age” spirituality is a somewhat fluid category of spiritual beliefs and practices that arose from the “hippie” and “counterculture” movement of the late 1960s. Teachers and practitioners of New Age spirituality blend Eastern spiritual traditions (e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism)\\ with some aspects of Western Christianity and a modern, secular humanist ethos.\nAfter the initial popularity of New Age spirituality in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of New Age ideas in the late late 1990s and early 2000s due to the populaity of self-help psychology books by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle’s is known best for his 1997 book The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment and his 2005 book A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose.\nIn 2008, the legendary Black talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, hosted Eckhart Tolle on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his book A New Earth. Oprah also added A New Earth to Oprah’s Book Club and hosted a 10-week live online class series where Eckhart Tolle discussed A New Earth chapter by chapter.\nSimilar fashion to other forms of New Age spirituality, A New Earth takes some ideas from the Bible, such as St. John’s vision of “a New Heaven and a New Earth” and subtly redefines it through the perspective of Eastern spiritual beliefs, practices, and terminology.\nIn particular, A New Earth builds on the concepts from Tolle’s previous book The Power of Now to focus on the Buddhist/Hindu idea that humans must go through an “ego death” so that their suffering will end and their individual identities (or the illusion of their individual identities) can melt away into a new, unified harmony with the universe. Within Tolle’s writing, this ego death is said to take place through practices such a Buddhist forms of emptying meditation that lead a person to awaken into a greater state of awareness or “consciousness” in moment or in the “now”. New Testament and New Age in Kendrick’s work “I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people” \u003e New Testament and New Age in Kendrick’s work While the influence of Christianity has already been well documented throughout this analysis, it should also be noted that Eckhart Tolle has clearly had a significant influence on Kendrick’s work beginning at least as early as 2021 when Kendrick released a video introducing his new media production company, pgLang. This introductory video contains imagery of meditative practices, a clock in which every hour is labeled as “now”, a scene were a young woman chooses “NOW” instead of “PAST” or “FUTURE”, and a scene were Kendrick sits across from Eckhart Tolle and listens intently as Tolle gives spiritual/psychologial guidance.\nOn Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Eckhart Tolle is introduced as Kendrick’s psychotherapist and a major contributor to the album.\nKodak Black, Oklama\nEckhart Tolle\nAnd this here is the big stepper\n-“Worldwide Stepper”\nWhitney: You really need some therapy.\nKendrick: Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin’ about?\nWhitney: Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck.\nKendrick: Shit, everybody stupid.\nWhitney: Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody. Reach out to Eckhart.\n-“Father Time” Eckhart Tolle’s voice is heard on several occasions on the second half of Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers.\nMr. Duckworth…\n-“Count Me Out”\nIf you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let’s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you…\n-“Savior (Interlude)”\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n-“Auntie Diaries”\nPeople get taken over by this pain-body, because this energy field that almost has a life of its own—it needs to periodically feed on more unhappiness.\n-“Mr. Morale” On the last verse of “Rich Spirit”, ends with Kendrick specifically referencing the “New Earth” after making references to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and other New Age concepts earlier in an the track.\nTakin’ my baby to school, then I pray for her\n‘Cause you bitches ain’t never been cool, writin’ testament\nPaintin’ pictures, put me in the Louvre, that’s a definite\nUniversal shift, I’m in a groove\n…\nThe aloof Buddha, I’m Christ with a shooter\nPraise to Muhammad, I might nigga noose ya\n…\nSpirit medium, I don’t rap, brother\n…\nI’m fasting four days out the week, brother\n…\nThe New Earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives Whether Kendrick is currently seeing a vision of the traditional Christian understanding of a “New Earth” or the New Age version, the reference to a peaceful “New Earth” is in sharp contrast to the increasingly violent rhetoric that Kendrick is using throughout the verse.\nKendrick seems to be implying that the end goal of a “New Earth” justifies the means of violent and inhumane vigilante executions. This “ends-justify-the-means” logic twists the prophetic vision of a “New Earth” into dystopian, totalitarian vision of a bloody revolution and political purge.\nLet’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies Mollies “Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies” \u003e Mollies After ordering the executions of social media influencers on the previous verse, Kendrick is now adding the followers of those influencers to the execution list.\nIn particular he calls out the follower who are “poppin mollies”. “Molly” is slang for the pure, molecular—from which we get the name molly—form of psychoactive drug MDMA. This pure form of MDMA is distinguished from the drug ecstasy in which MDMA is mixed with other substances.\nMDMA increases heart rate, makes users feel more energetic, induces increased emotional and sensory experience, increases feelings of connection and empathy and overall leads to feelings of euphoria. However, these positive feelings can lead to an emotional crash and increased anxiety after the effects of the drug wears off.\nMDMA was originally used in the 1970s to assist with psychotherapy for conditions such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, by the 1980s forms of MDMA and eventually molly began to be used as a “party drug” at raves, electronic music concerts and other dance parties. Molly’s status as a “party drug” connects to the recurring motif of “the party” throughout “Watch the Party Die”.\nMolly has also been referenced in the lyrics of a countless number of songs by “rappers that report the lies” and “parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth”.\nIt seems that Kendrick now wants to execute the followers who have been using mollie in order to prevent the usage of the drug from spreading to other innocent lives and negatively affective society. from the obvious degenerates Degenerates “from the obvious degenerates” \u003e Degenerates The “followers” who are “poppin mollie” seems to be following the influence of people who Kendrick describes as “degenerates”. The word “degenerate” refers morally corrupt people or more generally to people who have lost desirable physical, mental or social characteristics.\nLabeling a certain group of people with a term like “degenerates” has historicaly been a propaganda strategy for totalitarian rulers to justify eliminating certain cultural influences or killing off certain group of people. Most notably, in the Nazi Party in Germany began to describe modern art with the term “Entartete Kunst” meaning “Degenerate Art”. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany because such art was deemed “an insult to German feeling”. The Nazi party also ran a propaganda campaign against “Degenerate Music” which specifically targeted jazz music due to its “Negroid excesses in tempo” and “Jewishly gloomy lyrics.”\nGiven that Nazi propaganda would have labeled Kendrick’s own form of hip hop music as “Degenerate Music”, it is ironic that Kendrick is not labeling other media influencers as degenerates and executing them alongside “the radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary”. that’s failing to acknowledge the hope that we tryna spread Hope “that’s failing to acknowledge the hope that we tryna spread” \u003e Hope Kendrick again seems to be highlighting the hope of a “New Earth” that can be created after all of the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party” are elimiated from society.\nKendrick seems to be implying that the “degenerates” among the media influencers are spreading cynical criticism of Kendrick’s message of hope. This assessement is conistent with the lines from the first verse where Kendrick said:\nInfluencers talk down ‘cause I’m not with the basic shit\nBut they don’t hate me, they hate the man that I represent Because these influencers have been talking down at Kendrick and failing to talk positively about the hope that Kendrick and his supporters are trying to spread through Kendrick’s music, Kendrick has included these influencers among those who will be viciously executed.\nIf I'm not his vote then you need to bring his fuckin' head\nor film that shit in hi-res Vote “If I’m not his vote then you need to bring his fuckin’ head” \u003e Vote Kendrick’s campaign of totalitarian executions seems to be taking place that is a nominal democracy. Elections are still being held and Kendrick could theoretically be voted out of power. However, if anyone tries to oppose him by running an effective opposition campain or even casting a vote for the opposition, Kendrick wants such a person to be beheaded.\nThis kind of election where voters are not free to cast their vote without suffering retribution for voting against the ruling party is often referred to as a “sham election”.\nMonths before the release of “Watch the Party Die” in March of 2024, the United States and other Western European allies denounced Russia’s presidential election as a “sham election” after Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President of Russia with 88% of vote, which happed to be the highest percentage vote in the history of Russian democracy.\nVladimir Putin’s re-election follows more than a decade in which political opposition leaders have been harrassed, silenced, imprisoned and assasinated. The most recent casualty was Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian prison under suspicious circumstances in February of 2024, just a month before the election.\nOn the track “Savior” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick specifially highlighted Vladimir Putin as an example of oppresive leadership after he invaded Ukraine in Febrary of 2022 after claiming that Ukraine was governed by a neo-Nazi regime.\nVladimir making nightmares\nBut that’s how we all think\nThe collective conscious\nCalamities on repeat While Kendrick did highlight Vladimir Putin’s destructive behavior on “Savior”, Kendrick overall point seemed to be that Vladimir Putin is not unique or even outside of the norm. Instead, Kendrick asserted that Vladimir Putin’s behavior simply reveals the way that all of us natrually think. Here on “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick proudly expresses this collective way thought as he seeks to eliminate anyone who does not support his vigilante campaign.\nBring his head “you need to bring his fuckin’ head or film that shit in hi-res” \u003e Bring his head Kendrick again exhibits sadistic tendencies as he demands to see the decapitated head of the person who did not vote for Kendrick. The executioners must either bring the decapitated head to Kendrick to see or they must film the decapitation in a high resolution video format so that Kendrick can see all of the small details when he watches the recording.\nIt is also notable that the Gospel accounts of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke all tell the story about a wicked queen who conspires to have the king order the beheading of a John, the great prophet who baptized Jesus. Moreover, she got the king to bring John’s head to her on a dinner platter.\nJohn the Baptist was Jesus’s cousin and was highly respected prophet who called the Israelites to “repent” (i.e. change their way of thinking) and be baptized. John also spoke out against the unjust actions of powerful figures including Herod, the puppet king of a Roman-controlled, Israelite region called Galilee.\nJohn the Baptist publicly criticized King Herod, telling him that it was not right or just for him to take his own brother’s wife, Herodias, so that he could marry her for himself.\nThe new queen, Herodias, became very angry at St. John the Baptist and got King Herod to arrest John. Still the queen was not satisfied with just arresting St. John. She wanted him to be killed even though the king was very reluctant to do so. Queen Herodias then looked for a way to kill the prophet John, much like Queen Jezebel looked for a way to kill the prophet Elijah.\nThen when King Herod threw a birthday party for himself, the queen sent her daughter to dance for Herodias and his guests at the party. The queen’s daughter’s dancing was apparently so stimulating and pleasurable for King Herod that without thinking he made an oath in front of all his guests that he would give the queen’s daughter whatever she wanted.\nThe daughter consulted with her mother, who immediately told her to ask the king to bring her the head of John the Baptist on a dinner platter. The king was sad and upset with himself because he really didn’t want to kill John, but because he had made the oath in front of his guests and was too proud to look dishonorable by going back on his word, he agreed. He immediately ordered soldiers to decapitate John the Baptist and bring the head on a platter to the daughter who then presented it to the queen.\nThe fact that John the Baptist was decapitated due to a party where a younger girl danced in a sensual way to gratify a group of powerful men brings us back to the motif of “the party” and the alleged trafficing of underage girls for sex parties at Drake’s mansion.\nAt the same time, by demanding for his executionors to bring him a the head of the man who refused to vote for him, Kendrick, the King of LA, is now playing the role of King Herod and Queen Herodias who unjustly killed the prophet, John the Baptist. Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do? Lecrae “Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do” \u003e Lecrae Here for the first time in “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick seems to reconsider whether he is doing the right thing by executing the hosts and attendees of “the party”.\nIn particular Kendrick wonders whether Lecrae, a famous Christian rapper, would pray for the hosts and attendees of the party or “fuck these niggas up” by violently assaulting them.\nLecrae happens to be the most famous and successful artist in the history of the Christian hip hop (aka CHH). Christian hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that utilizes similar production, rapping and singing styles as mainstream hip hop. However, unlike mainstream hip hop, Christian hip hip is committed to presenting lyrics that help people understand and identify with Christian values, beliefs, and behavior.\nBecause of the necessary commitment to Christian values, beliefs and behavior, artists that are accepted as part of Christian hip hop will not make songs that glorify scamming, gluttony, sexual promiscuity or criminal activity. In fact it is very rare for Christian hip hip artists to release music with any words that would be considered explicit: including profanity, sexual terminology or racial slurs.\nDespite the high moral and behavioral expectations that come with being a Christian hip hop artis, Lecrae had a rough upbriging that was similar to many mainstream hip hop artists.\nLecrae never met his father and was raised by a single mother in a low income, urban, Black neighborhood. He was not raised as a Christian but became a very committed Christian later in life. That background has allowed Lecrae to speak to the reality of “street life” while also being able to clearly articulate Jesus’s teaching in language that is accessible to urban, Black audiences.\nSimilar to Kendrick on To Pimp a Butterfly, DAMN. and Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Lecrae has also publicly wrestled with his faith in God, hypocrisy among Christian leaders including himself, depression, personal struggles with addiction, and the weight of serving as a leader in a Black community facing various social issues.\nLast year I was feeling hopeless\nI just wanted it to end\nPeople stealing money from me, man\nI swear I thought that we was friends\nAnd I was so depressed, I was such a mess\nI couldn’t shake it off\nAnother murder on the television\nMan, somebody go turn it off\nI spoke my mind, I got attacked for it\nThought these people had my back boy\nThen they tellin’ me I asked for it\nI guess I’m just another black boy\nAnd then they killed Tamir Rice\nAnd they just go on with they life\nThey tellin’ me shut up talking ‘bout it\nLike, I should just talk about Christ\nBut the truth is I started to doubt God\nI started to question my purpose\nI started to act out\nI ain’t wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile\nDoctors told me that my man died\nI almost had a breakdown So tell depression it can fly away\nTell my doubts that they can die today\nI’ma catch me a wave, sail away\nCan’t stop me now\n-“Can’t Stop Me Now (Destination)”\nI would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such\nYou know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch\nI was so involved, never thought that I could fall, y’all\nRight before the fall of 2015, I was all off\nIt involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down\nTweeted ‘bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground\nAnd Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times\nThis time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized\nDoubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame\n“Shame on you, ‘Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus’ name”\nCut me deep, I was losing sleep, “God, ain’t these Your sheep?”\nWhy they hate me like they do? Maybe grace is really cheap\nMaybe this is all a lie, they don’t really love me\nThey just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public\nThey’re like following they God mean turnin’ on Black people\nIs Black evil? Why do they hate and attack people?\nI’m vulnerable and cautious, I’m reading Baldwin\nTa-Nehisi got me thinking, now I’m going all in\nI ain’t know if God was real no mo’\nEvery day we gettin’ killed and I can’t deal no mo’\nI started slipping in the darkness, I’m feeling heartless\nChristians got me traumatized, I don’t know who God is\nDrinking liquor for my therapy, and smoking Mary tree\nMaybe I should get divorced, I don’t know why she married me\nWhat’s the purpose? What’s the point?\nNothing matters, I’m just matter, I’m just atoms\nAin’t no Eve and ain’t no Adam\nWhere the Xannies? Let me at ’em\nI was floating in confusion until I dropped\nWoke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped -“Deconstruction” Given his background and spiritual perspective, Lecrae seems to be the perfect person to provide Kendrick with a perspective on whether Kendrick should rely on prayer or use violence to improve society.\nIt is also notable that prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Lecrae released a podcast episode in which he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake.\nIn the podcast episode, Lecrae accepted that rap battles as an established part of hip hop culture. Since Lecrae grew up with hip hop culture, he was reluctant to criticize rap battles in and of themselves.\nLecrae also acknowledged that Kendrick was providing Drake with some feedback that he probably needed to hear.\nWe all need friends like Kendrick who are willing to tell us about ourselves. I never want to have to run into somebody in a rap battle to tell me the truth about myself.\nHowever, Lecrae did express his concern that the way that Kendrick and Drake approached the rap battle (and to some extent how most rappers approach rap battles) demonstrates an unhealthy attempt to build their own sense of value and self-worth based on their ability to beat down another person.\nPrayer ““Fuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?” \u003e Prayer Prayer was a major motif within DAMN.. Throughout that album, Kendrick repeatedly lamented that fact that no one was praying for him. However, at a pivotal point of the album, Kendrick’s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail telling Kendrick that the cursed existence that he was experiencing was not due to a lack of people praying for Kendrick but due to a lack of Kendrick following God’s commandments.\nNew Kung Fu Kenny\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\n…\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n-“ELEMENT.”\nShit I feel like\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\nAin’t nobody prayin’\n…\nI feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me? -“FEEL.”\nNobody pray for me\nIt been that day for me\n-“HUMBLE.”\nWhat’s up, family? Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin’ you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo’ mind lately and I know you feel like, you know people ain’t been prayin’ for you but you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, “The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness, and astonishment of heart.” See, family, that’s why you feel like you feel, like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way…\nVerse 2 says, “You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities”. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse, because He said He’s gonna punish us. The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel - He’s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods. “That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee.” So, just like you chasten your own son, He’s gonna chasten you, because He loves you. So that’s why we get chastised. That’s why we’re in the position that we’re in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us. We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live, here, in today, in the United States of America. I love you, family, and I pray for you. God bless you. Shalom.\n-“FEAR.” DAMN. thus conveys the idea that prayer is insufficient if individual do not change the way that they live and begin to follow God’s commandments. This idea about the need to follow God’s commandments and help other to follow God’s commandments might thus present a third way as opposed to exclusively praying or exclusively “fucking these niggas up.”\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1 Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry Dee-1 is another Christian hip hop artist whose career has run in paralle to Lecrae’s. Dee-1’s first mixtape was released in 2004, the same year that Lecrae released his first album. However, Dee-1 has not come close to acheiving the level success or influence that Lecrae has had throughout his career.\nPart of this gap in success could be attributed to skill level and artistic choices. However, from Dee-1’s perspective a big part of the gap in success is due to the fact that Dee-1 has been uncompromising in his commitment to deliver music with a clear Christian message and a willingness to call out issues in hip hop culture and the music industry that he sees as being misaligned with Jesus’s teaching.\nWith a timing and perspective that runs almost parallel to Katt Williams, Dee-1 gave given an interview in January of 2024 where he discussed how he has been denied opportunities from entertainment industry “gatekeepers” because he wouldn’t compromize his own integrity. Most notably, Dee-1 talked about haveing to say “no” to powerful men in the entertainment industry who tried to coerce him into performing oral sex or receiving anal sex in order to receive a record deal.\nThere’s gatekeepers. So if you’re trying to get signed to a major label, there’s gatekeepers. If you’re trying to get on certain media platforms to get interviewed, there’s gatekeepers. If you trying to get on the mainstream radio, urban radio, there’s gatekeepers. Yes. Yes. Yes.\nI will say one last thing about gatekeepers—the only true gatekeeper to what’s meant for you in this world is God and your level of integrity. That’s the only two gatekeepers, because what’s meant for you and what you want that’s two different things and a lot of times people end up wanting things that ain’t of God. Now if you want something that ain’t of God, you got to go through gatekeepers…, who really ain’t nobody in in the big scheme of things on the totem pole of people with integrity and people with morals values and principles. These gatekeepers ain’t nobody, but in this perverted sick twisted industry these gatekeepers do hold access to certain levels, you know.\nBro, I’ve had gatekeepers in the music industry who have literally tried to hold a record deal behind their back and let me know like, “Look,if you a part of this homosexual act that I’m trying to take part in, this door open real quick fory you.” I got a song where I’ve talked about that before called “The Devil’s Playground.” This is real dog and the only way that that type of stuff can work on you is if you let them have all the leverage to where you want what’s behind that gate that bad. So that’s that’s a real thing.\nYou also got people—this a different type of gatekeeper—the gatekeepers who will say, “Hey you making too much righteous noise right now. If you just tone that righteousness down a little bit then we’ll allow you into these doors, but you got to tone that down. You got to becomea little more vanilla, a little more lukewarm, a little more bland and you’ll fit in with us. That’s the slick gatekeeping. It ain’t telling you to all the way, you know, bend over or or open your mouth or something like that. It ain’t that, but it’s telling you like dim your light. And what ends up happening is you got so many people that’s like, “Well that’s not that bad. They not asking me to do nothing super crazy I just got to dim my light.” That’s the scariest kind right there ‘cause a lot of people will be like, “Wait I just got to turn it from level 10 to level 5? Man, bet. I could do that. Bro, all right, bet. Now I get accepted. Cool.” Next thing, you know you got a whole industry that’s lukewarm—whole industry lukewarm, so that when somebody that’s on fire come along they looking at it like, “Whoa, you crazy! Hold on. You shining too bright. Hold on. Hold on. Chill out, man. You doing the most. You messing up, man. Stop man.” As mentioned in that interview, back in 2017, Dee-1 released a track called “The Devil’s Playground” in which he mentioned having to say no to powerful man in music industry who offered to manage Dee-1 if Dee-1 would have sex with him. Dee-1 highlighted this experience as an example of how the entire music industry is under the control of Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”).\nLucifer laughs when he listens to the radio\nEnjoyin’ all the hate blastin’ through the stereo\nHis plan worked, our music gives him glory\nSex, drugs, and murder now listen to this story…\nDown here with these devils in the playground\nEvil forces workin’ hard I can’t play around\nI can feel ’em tryin’ to drag me down\nThink I’m gonna lose this battle now\nI’m in the trenches here in Babylon\nThis world of darkness that I travel on\nI know the games that the devil plays\nI feel him creepin’ I can’t get away\nDevils on devils on devils on devils on devils\nThey all in this industry\nNot everybody real, and\nFor the dollar bill friends turn into my enemies\nThey knew I was broke\nSo they asked me to sell my soul\nThree Million dollars plus make a blood sacrifice\nBut I said, “Nooooooo”!\nThis man said if I slept with him he’ll manage me\nYeah, ya’ll know him\nI spit in his face and said, “boy don’t play with me!”\nI said, “Lord this just too much”\nSo I’m just gonna work with church folk\nThen I found out some of these church folk\nBe some of the most crooked on Earth folk\n…\nIt’s entertainment but it’s deeper, though\nBehind the scenes there’s some things you don’t even know\nMessin’ with this game, you could lose your soul\n‘Cause there’s an evil creepin’ deep below\n…\nYou think you the man, don’t ya?\nBut the Devil got his hand on ya\nThe Devil’s just usin’ you\nHe makin’ a fool of you\nYeah, I’m talkin’ to you, you right there\nThe one with the fame, the one with the money\nThe one with the platinum plaques, yeah, yeah\nYou know your name!\nI came in the game with the flame and I aim to be sayin’\nEverything in the name of the Man who created\nThe land, the sand, the sun, and the moon\nHolds life in the palm of his hand\nDo you hear what I’m sayin’?\nMan, I’m really tryin’ to wake you\nThis ain’t no game so I can’t be playful\nSellin’ these lies, music that’s hateful\nThe devil say you great, but God say you ungrateful (echo)\nSo what we gonna do now?\nThis ain’t beef it’s more deep\nI don’t fight for me, I fight for the army of G-O-D\nBut I luv you dawg, my brother for life\nSeparated at birth, but I pray you come to the light Kendrick exposes the satanic music industry “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Kendrick exposes the satanic music industry Dee-1’s claim that the music industry is under the control of Lucifer / the “devil” is a view that Kendrick has also expressed going back to 2015 with the tracks “Alright” and “For Sale? (Interlude)” from *To Pimp a Butterfuly\". In those tracks, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of a music industry leader named “Lucy”, short for Lucifer, who approach Kendrick and offered Kendrick wealth, success, and material possessions if Kendrick would sell his soul to her.\nWhat you want you, a house? You, a car?\nForty acres and a mule?

In Kendrick’s retelling, Lucifer is a fallen angel who has been reincarnated numerous times in the form of various musicians whose gluttony led them to use their musical skills and influence to deceive the masses and mentally enslave them under Lucifer’s control.\nI did past life regression last year and it fucked me up\nReincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus\nBody after body, lesson after lesson, let’s take it back to Michigan in 1947\nMy father kicked me out the house ‘cause I wouldn’t listen to him\nI didn’t care about his influence, only loved what I was doing\nGifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level\nThe most talented where I’m from, but I had to rebel\nAnd so I’m off in the sunset, searchin’ for my place in the world\nWith my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled\nI found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect\nWhile the record business loved me\nI was head of rhythm and blues\nThe women that fell to they feet, so many to choose\nBut I manipulated power as I lied to the masses\nDied with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated\n…\nAnother life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin’ Circuit\nSeductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains\nMy voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed\nA musical genius what the articles emphasized\nHad everything I wanted, but I couldn’t escape addiction\nHeroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted\nTurned on my family, I went wherever cameras be\nCocaine, no private planes for my insanity\nSelf-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments\nI needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin\nFuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar\nSex and melodies gave me hope when nobody’s lookin’\nMy first assistant was a small town scholar\nNever did a Quaalude ’til I got myself around her\nMy daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me\nI died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated\n…\nMy present life is Kendrick Lamar\nA rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe\nThe only factor I respected was raisin’ the bar\nMy instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh\nMy father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him\nI’m old enough to understand the way I was livin’\nEgo and pride had me looking at him with resentment\nI close my eyes, hoping that I don’t come off contentious\nI’m yelling, “Father, did I finally get it right?” Everything I did was selfless\nI spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them\nI didn’t gloat, even told ’em, “No,” when the vultures came\nTook control of my fleshly body when the money changed\nSon, you do well, but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\nFather, I’m not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down\n“But your pride has to die,” okay, Father, show me how\nTell me every deed that you done and what you do it for\nI kept one hundred institutions paid\nOkay, tell me more\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage\nOkay, tell me more\nI’m tryna push peace in L.A.\nBut you love war\nNo, I don’t\nOh, yes, you do\nOkay, then tell me the truth\nEvery individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there’s no forgiveness in your heart?\nI could tell you where I’m going\nI could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of Heaven ‘cause you was anxious\nDidn’t like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth ‘cause you was broken\nRehabilitation, not psychosis\nBut now we here now\nCenturies you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evilish views\nAnd all I ever wanted from you was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it’s not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI’m using words for inspiration as an idea\nSo can you promise that you won’t take your gifts for granted?\nI promise that I’ll use my gifts to bring understanding\nFor every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\nYou crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity\nAnd I’m ashamed that I ever created that enemy\nThen let’s rejoice where we at\nI rewrote the devil’s story just to take our power back, ‘carnated\n-“reincarnated” Call It Like It Is “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Call It Like It Is Prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Dee-1 released a podcast episode which discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake. In comparison to Lecrae’s podcast, Dee-1 was much more willing to directly criticize Drake, Kendrick and the culture of rap battles as a whole.\nFrom Dee-1’s uncompromising perspective, the entire battle between Kendrick and Drake has glorified negative examples of hatred and unrighteous relationships that are a detriment to the Black community and misaligned with Jesus’s teaching.\nDee-1 also released an uncompromising response to “Watch the Party Die” in the form a track titled “Call It Like It Is”.\nI want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1\nBut I will—\nYeah, I don’t care what these people think, I’m trying to make these people think\nWhat’s up, Kendrick? We flippin’ tables, man, (Call it like it is), alright\n…\nY’all done turned this culture trash, these so-called legends ain’t no legends\nI don’t care if they sold millions, are you hearin’ their message?\nPoisonin’ our whole community, everybody hypnotized\nWhy you think nobody respect black people?

Given Dee-1’s consistent, uncompromising commitment to Jesus’s teaching above Black identity, hip hop culture, personal grievances or revolutionary philosophies, Kendrick probably knows that Dee-1 would “show ’em just what prayer do” without a second thought.\nKendrick’s contradictions “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Kendrick’s contradictions Kendrick sees within Dee-1 an empathetic, Christ-centered heart that Kendrick has deep inside of himself even while his hardened exterior has led him to advocate for killing the killers, burning the whole village, mortifying family members, cracking skulls, imposing agony, decapitating those who oppose him.\nThis contradiction between Kendricks Christian-leaning heart and his tendencies towards violence (or at least existing in an environment of violence) is a major theme of Kendrick’s work throughout his discography.\nSmokin’ on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nDrank until I can’t no mo’, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nReally I’m a sober soul\nBut I’m with the homies right now\nAnd we ain’t askin’ for no favors\nRush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah\nReally, I’m a peacemaker\nBut I’m with the homies right now\n-“The Art of Peer Pressure”\nNo better picture to paint than me walkin’ from Bible study\nAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my face\nFrom a function that tooken place, they was wonderin’ if I bang\nStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks\nI don’t mind ‘cause one day you’ll respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d city\n-“good kid”\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey’d probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\n…\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?\nPerceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it’s safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of bein’ a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage\nKill ’em all if they gossip\n-“m.A.A.d city”\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, as blood spilled on your hands**\n-“Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite!\n-“Blacker the Berry”\nThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts, he’s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered\nEnding the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\n-“Mortal Man”\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ creativity\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of missin’ out on you and me\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear of losin’ loyalty from pride\n‘Cause my DNA won’t let me evolve in the light of God\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that love ain’t livin’ here no more\nI’m talkin’ fear, fear that it’s wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\n-“FEAR.”\nI love my father for tellin’ me to take off the gloves\n‘Cause everything he didn’t want was everything I was\n-“Father Time”\nI’m sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody\nOne man standin’ on two words, heal everybody\n…\nWhere’s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today\n-“Mother I Sober” Speaking from the heart “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1” \u003e Speaking from the heart It is worth noting that according to Jesus’s teaching, it is not possible for someone to have a truly empathetic heart if that persons words and actions are not consistently empathetic.\nIn the same speech from St. Matthew’s account of the Gospel where Jesus taught his disciples the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus used a metaphor of trees and fruit to teach his disciples that people who have good in their heart will produce good words and actions and anyone who had evil in their heartwill produce evil words and actions. By contrast, anyone who produces evil words and actions does not truly have good in their hearts.\nBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are greedy wolves. By their fruits you will know them. Can you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. Every tree that doesn’t grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.\n-Matthew 7:15-20 In a parallel speech in St. Lluke’s account of the Gospel according, Jesus gives the same teaching while specifically using the word heart.\nThe good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from the abundance that fills a person’s heart.\n-Luke 6:43-45 Jesus’s warning against false, corrupt prophets is particularly notable given that on “Mortal Man”, throughout “DAMN.” and on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick has spoken about how he is prophet to the Black community in America.\nHence, from the perspective of Jesus’s teaching, Kendrick’s inconsistent actions and words—particularly within “Watch the Party Die”—would seem to indicate that there is a deep inconsistency within Kendrick’s heart as Kendrick’s heart seems to contain both empathy and a pathological desire for ruthless vigilante retribution.\nBut I will— Censored “But I will—” \u003e Censored Unexpectedly, Kendrick never finishes this line. He seems to be censoring himself. We are thus left to guess what Kendrick intended to say (“Dee-1” could be rhymed with “gun”).\nThat being said, the specifics of what the uncensored line might not be that important. Thus far, all the lines on the verses have been advocating for the use of violence to execute people who Kendrick judges to be detrimental to society. Almost surely, the uncensored line would have continued the same trend. The more interesting question is why amongst all the lines that contained profanity and violence, Kendrick picked this line to censor.\nThe censorship here could convey the idea that the uncensored line would have been so extremely violent and direct that it would make the song “X-rated”.\nThe previous time that Kendrick got so specific about the way that he would kill killer was on the track “XXX.” where Kendrick rapped:\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga lil’ bit of nothin’\nI chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap\nWalk myself to the court like, “Bitch, I did that”\nX-rated Given that Dee-1 does not use profanity or advocate for people to commit acts of violence, Kendrick’s tendency towards X-rated content again positions Kendrick as someone who is in many ways the exact opposite of Dee-1.\nIt's time to get these devils out the way\nheavy metals on my sword Heavy metals “It’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword” \u003e Heavy metals After previously referring to his execution targets as “degenerates” Kendrick continues to escalate his rhetoric by seemingly referring to them as “devils”. Labeling his execution targets as “devils” again seems to be an attempt to justify certain groups of people with a sword, potentially involving more decapitations.\n“Heavy metal” is a subgenre of rock music which tends to feature violent and spiritually dark imagery in the song lyrics and band names.\nThe original meaning of “heavy metals” refers to a category of chemical elements from the periodic table of elements. Kendrick thus seems to be making a subtle reference to his song “ELEMENT.” where he justified and glorified using violence to take revenge and fight against his enemies.\nI’m willin’ to die for this shit\nI done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit\nPut the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit\nD-O-T my enemy, won’t catch a vibe for this shit, ayy\nI been stomped out in front of my mama\nMy daddy commissary made it to commas\nBitch, all my grandmas dead\nSo ain’t nobody prayin’ for me, I’m on your head, ayy\n…\nI’m willin’ to die for this shit, nigga\nI’ll take your fuckin’ life for this shit, nigga\nWe ain’t goin’ back to broke, family sellin’ dope\nThat’s why you maney-ass rap niggas better know\nIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I’ma make it look sexy\nIf I gotta go hard on a bitch, I’ma make it look sexy\nI pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy\nThey won’t take me out my element\nNah, take me out my element\n…\nI’m allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy\nAn imaginary rich nigga, ayy\nSeven figures ho, that’s slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy\nGoin’ digital and physical on all y’all, ayy\n…\nMost of y’all just envy, but jealousy get you killed\nMost of y’all throw rocks and try to hide your hand\nJust say his name and I promise that you’ll see Candyman Spiritual swordfights “It’s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword” \u003e Spiritual swordfights It is notable that in St. Paul’s letter to the Church in Ephesus, St. Paul uses the imagery of armor, swords and warfare as a metaphor to describe how Christians should fight against spiritual forces including the “devi” (aka “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) and the “element” forces of the world.\nFinally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the methodology of the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”]. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the element, against the powers, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.\nTherefore put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of right relationships, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News (aka Gospel) of peace, above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints.\n-Ephesians 6:10-18 In that passage, St. Paul makes it clear that Christians are not meant to be fighting or killing other humans (or as St. Paul says “flesh and blood”), because other humans are never the real enemy. Instead, St. Paul instructs the member of the church to go to war against “spiritual forces of wickedness”, not the humans who are doing things that are “too wicked to apologize”.\nIn order to defend against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to put on “spiritual armor” which refers to virtues such as truth, right relationships, peace derived from Jesus’s Good News, faith, salvation.\nIn order to fight offensively against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to wield “the sword of the Spirit” which is a metaphor for the “word of God” that is conveyed though Jesus’s teachings as told in the texts of Bible.\nSt. Paul also instructs Christians to fight the spiritual war “with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit.”\nSimilarly, in St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul made it clear that Christians are not meant to use physical weapons to fight against human enemies but spiritual weapons to fight against prideful patterns and thoughts and arguments which attempt to exalt themselves to make mak humans act according to those prideful patterns of thoughts and arguments instead of obeying Jesus’s commandments.\nFor though we walk in the [flesh / body], we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires], for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying arguments and all pride that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ.\n-2 Corinthians 10:3-5 Hence, St. Paul clearly teaches Christians to “show ’em what prayer do”. Moreover, St. Paul also instructs Christians to be transformed by Jesus’s teaching so that they can develop the kinds of virtues that will allow them to fight against prideful thoughts and arguments that would justify wickedness, including any acuments that would justify brutally killing other humans.\nWe settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce “We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce” \u003e Hollywood divorce “Hard” seems to be connected to the idea of “heavy metal” on the previous line. These “hard disputes” seem to be part of some unresolvable marital conflict that will eventually end in divorce. Based on the context of the song, it would seem that Kendrick plans to settle these “hard disputes” by killing the people with whom he has a dispute.\nAdditionally, the reference to a “ghetto Hollywood divorce”, suggests that the dispute could be “contract dispute” between Black artists and an entertainment industry company.\nHere Kendrick seems to be commenting on the relationship that “corporate guys” and “rappers who tell the lies” have forged to profit from distributing fabricated stories about being “street niggas just like Hollywood has profited from distributing fabricated stories.\nKendrick also seems to be alluding to the Outkast song “Hollywood Divorce”, in which Outkast, Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg used the image of a volatile Hollywood celebrity marriage as an extended metaphor for how entertainment industries appropriate Black culture only to later divorce themselves from the Black artists while holding on to the profits and intellectual property.\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n…\nAnd I’m a star\nYeah, and I don’t have to go to Hollywood\n‘Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on\nI really think they’re stealing from us like a sample song\nI really wish one day we’d take it back like Hammer’s home\nThe hurricane come and took my Louisiana home\nAnd all I got in return was a durn country song\nThis whole country wrong\nOh, but you right if you just put a little ice on\nAnd cut your mic on but you don’t even write songs\nBut Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra\nI’m so not sober, I’m high like a Hollywood\nCoffee or soda, you can call me a roller\nHold up, your grill’s glistenin’\nSpent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different\nWhat’s the real sense of it?\nBling bling, I know and did you know\nI’m the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm\nThey let it sit too long, they just makin’ it burn\nMake a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn\nLike a dead body burned on the mantle piece\nThat’s why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease\nAnd I be’s the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze\nDefrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne\nBut in Hollywood it’s Litt-le Wayne, don’t make me none\nSo that’s why I got a pre-nup\nI do\n…\nI do, love you but you hate me at the same time\nLights, camera, action, it’s game time\nDo you take this here as your lovely wife?\nTo love her and cherish her for all your life?\nI solemnly swear to dare share and take you there\nAnd me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair\nIt’s been a long time, we walked a thin line\nOthers say they got you, but you been mine\nAs I sit back and watch all the catfights\nDomestic violence — is that right?\nBut you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight\nAnd now I’m growin’ up, showin’ up, blowin’ up\nI never ever thought that we would separate at all\nBut you played me like a game of football\nUsed to feed me, need me, dress me\nNow it’s so messy, straight cut out and left me\n…\n(Starts off like a small town marriage)\nHollywood divorce\nAll the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing\n(Lively wife and life, baby carriage)\nLook at blues, rock, jazz, rap\n(Now all the stars have cars, success of course)\nNot even talkin’ about music\nEverything else, too\n(But it ends in Hollywood divorce)\nBy the time it reach Hollywood, it’s over\n(Hollywood divorce)\nBut it’s cool\nWe just keep it goin’ and make new shit\nTake our game, take our name\nGive us a little fame\nAnd then they kick us to the curb, that’s a cold thang Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores\nYou let ’em snack, they eat your face Culture vultures “Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores” \u003e Culture vultures With the line, “the culture bred with carnivores”, Kendrick seems to be alluding to the famously influential lines from Jay-Z’s 2001 song “Izzo” in which Jay-Z describe corporate leaders in the music industry as “vultures” who scavenge off Black culture\nI do this for my culture, to let ’em know\nWhat a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster\nShow ’em how to move in a room full of vultures\nIndustry shady, it need to be taken over\nLabel owners hate me, I’m raisin’ the status quo up\nI’m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush\nPay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us\nWe can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks More recently in Migos’s 2017 track, “T-Shirt” from their album “Culture”, Migos member, Quavo, referenced those lines from “Izzo” while discussing how “vultures” will “bite”, which is slang for stealing.\nDo it for the culture (Culture)\nThey gon’ bite like vultures (Vultures) The carnivores that Kendrick mention here thus seem to be culture vultures who will eat artists for a snack. Kendrick specifically mentions that the carnivores will “eat your face”, which conveys the idea that cultures vultures seek to erase an artist’s identity along with any associate or credit that the artist would have to their work. In the phrase “bred with carnivores”, the word “bred” primarily refers to the reproduction of vulture from one generation to the next. However, “bred” is also a double entendre for the food item “bread” which connects to the idea of vulture eating. This line then turns into a triple entendre when we realize that “bread” is also slang for “money” which would indicate that the “corporate guys” from the entertainment industry are eating up all the money that rightfully belongs to the artist.\nBy saying “Say hello to your future fate”, Kendrick seems to be asserting that getting eaten and erased by culture vultures is guaranteed to be the fate of any artist who remains trapped in the grip of the entertainment industry for any substatial amount of time.\nthe signatures is bein’ forged Forged signatures “the signatures is bein’ forged” \u003e Forged signatures Kendrick seems to be warning other hip hop artists about the hard disputes and metaphorical divorce that will happen to them in the future if they sign a contract with an exploitative entertainment company.\nThe word “forged” refers to a fake signature that is used to establihs a fraudulent legal agreement but is also double entendre referring to the process of shaping metal into a weapon, tool or object. This connects back to previous line about “heavy metals on my sword” that was used to “get these devils out the way”.\nThe idea that the signatures are being “forged” indicates that the “corporate guys” in the entertainment industry are actually committing acts of fraud to illegally profit from “rappers that report the lies” and use the leverage of paid lawyers and the legal system against Black artists.\nThe imagery of signatures from the entertainment industry also brings to mind the To Pimp a Butterfly track “For Sale? (Interlude)” in which Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) comes to Kendrick in the form of a music industry executive named Lucy. Lucy tries to get Kendrick to sign a contract to sell his soul to her in exchange for wealth, possessions and an agreement that Kendrick will stop praying and abandon his loving relationship with God the Father.\nMy name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick\nUsually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick\nLucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories\nAbout these rappers that I came after when they was boring\nLucy gon’ fill your pockets\nLucy gon’ move your mama out of Compton\nInside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised\nLucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?\nIt’s not so easy, I’m at these functions accordingly\nKendrick, Lucy don’t slack a minute, Lucy work harder\nLucy gon’ call you even when Lucy know you love your Father\nI’m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly\nLucy don’t mind, ‘cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me\nLucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front\nLucy got paperwork on top of paperwork\nI want you to know that Lucy got you\nAll your life I watched you\nAnd now you all grown up to sign this contract,\nif that’s possible They wonder why I’m not enthused to drop subsection “They wonder why I’m not enthused to drop” \u003e Drop The word “drop” refers to Kendrick releasing or “dropping” a new album, which is something that had been heavily anticipated during and after the battle with Drake.\nAfter hearing about sexual predators, unfaithful corporate partners, fraudulent devils and culture vultures in the entertainment industry it is no wonder that Kendrick is unenthusiastic about dropping a new album.\nA few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would release his next full length album, GNX. Throughout GNX Kendrick discusse the challenges of navigating through the evil, satanic control of the entertainment industry, particular on the track “reincarnated”. The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried More visible, more tried “The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried” \u003e More visible, more tried After focusing on the justification for committing acts of physical violence against his enemies, it is notable that this is the first time on either verse where Kendrick has really focused on how he is being tested and tried spiritually.\nKendrick seems to be expressing the idea that he and other true artists face increasingly difficult struggles and trials as they become increasingly famous and visible to the public.\nThis line expresses a similar idea and ethos to the Notorious B.I.G., Ma$e and Diddy’s famous song “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems”\nI don’t know what they want from me\nIt’s like the more money we come across\nThe more problems we see The challenge of being tried spiritually seems to be one of the main reasons that Kendrick is “not enthused to drop” a new album, since droping a new album will only increase his visibility and his trials. The idea of increased spiritually trials coming after increased visibility is also illustrated in Gospel accounts which describe how Jesus was tried by the [“devil” / “satan” / “false accusers” / “diabolical one”] immediately after God the Father opened the skies, spoke audibly to declare that Jesus was his “beloved son” and sent the Holy Spirit in the visible form of a dove to show that Jesus is the anointed king (aka the Christ) over God’s people.\nAfter Jesus was baptized, he came up immediately from the water; and behold, the skies were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him, and behold, a voice from the skies said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil.\n-Matthew 3:16-4:1 It’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified Petrified “It’s cynical to say I know these artists petrified” \u003e Petrified For the last few lines Kendrick has been shown himself to be very cynical about the entertainment industry, which gobbles up artists like vultures. Artists who recognize the dangers of the entertainment industry are understandably afraid and even “petrified”.\nWhile the word “petrified” can be used as a synonym for “afraid”, the most concreate meaning of “petrified” refers to any kind of organic plant or animal material that is turned into stone. Organic material is petrified when water brings small minerals into the formerly living plant or animal and slowly replaces all of the organic flesh with rock-hard material.\nBecoming “petrified” actually serves as a great metaphor for hip hop as a living, flexible, organic culture being infiltrated by slick corporate guys and entertainment companies who kill hip hop artists (or more specifically kill hip hop artists consciousness as Kendrick mentioned in “Worldwide Steppers”) then seek to replace the flexible, organic culture of hip hop with a rock hard, inflexible, inorganic focus on making profit. This process eventually turns Black artists into hard-hearted individuals who are deadened to the world and can no longer grow.\nIt is notable that the within the Old Testament, the Prophet Ezekiel explained that God had allowed the Israelites to be defeated, dispursed and enslaved because of they had hearts of stone which did not desire God or the justice that comes from God. However, Ezekiel also prophesied about a day in the future when God would free them from slavery, bring them back to their own land and transform their old hearts of stone into new hearts of flesh which would truly desire God and be able to act with justice.\nFor I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols. I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the heart of stone out of your bodies, and I will give you a heart of flesh. I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my prescriptions. You will obey my justice and do just acts. You will reside in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God.\n-Ezekiel 36:24-28 From a biblical pespective, becoming “petrified” is thus equivalent to being enslaved or imprisoned by an oppressor due to idolatrous desire for material possessions.\nThe end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies End result “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e End result Kendrick suggests that dealing with the evils of the entertainment industry can only lead to two possible end results for artists: Either the artist will be locked up “in jail by Jezebel” or “drugged up full of lies”.\nWith either of these results, the artist will lose the freedom to create truthful works of art. Jezebel “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e Jezebel As mentioned in the analysis of the line “Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time”, Jezebel was a wicked woman who became queen of the Northern Kingdom of Israel after she married a wicked king named Ahab.After becoming queen, Jezebel replaced the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with the worship of the fertility god name Ba’al. Queen Jezebel then either killed or imprisoned most of the true prophets of God, while a hundred of God’s prophets escaped to hide in caves.\nThe prophet Elijah was the only prophet who was protected and empowered to openly confront Queen Jezebel and King Ahab. Elijah challenged the prophets of the fertility Ba’al to a competition to in which the prophets of Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Ba’al, the fertility god, would each ask the deity whom they worshiped to send down fire from the skies to burn up a sacrifice on an altar.\nAfter Yahweh, the God of Israel, proved to be the only deity capable of sending down fire from the skies, Elijah compelled the Israelites to round up the prophets of Ba’al and kill them.\nThe death of Ba’al’s prophets enraged Queen Jezebel. Shen then swore that she would kill Elijah, which caused Elijah to run for his life. Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet on “Mortal Man”, throughout DAMN. and at severl moments on other tracks. Here in “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick the seems see himself as the modern equivalent of the prophet Elijah who is at risk of having his artistic output locked up by the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry.\nDrugged up “The end result, in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies” \u003e Drugged up The term “drugged up” is used to describe a person who is noticeably being under the influence of drugs, whether prescription drugs or recreational drugs.\nIn many cases, someone who is “drugged up” may not be fully aware of their surroundings and thus is in a vulernable state in which someone could take advantage of them.\nThe idea of being drugged up connects back to the earlier reference to the drug MDMA in the line “Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies”.\nIn the current line, Kendrick seems to imply that artists who are have succumbed to their desires from pleasure and the exploitation of the entertainment industry will be drugged up with “lies”.\nThe idea of artists being under the influence of lies also connects back to earlier lines where Kendrick ordered the execution of those who told lies or failed to provide truth to their young audience.\nIf you parade in gluttony without givin’ truth to the youth\nThe graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose\n…\nI think it’s time to watch the party die\nStreet niggas and the corporate guys\nthe rappers that report the lies In the current line, Kendrick seems to suggest that the minds of “rappers that report the lies” eventually become altered and distorted as they become intoxicated by the lies that they have consumed and are not regurgitating to the masses.\nBeing “drugged up” may also lead a person to lose consciousness.\nFittingly, since the 1990s the word “conscious” has been used to describe hip hop artists such as Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Lupe Fiasco who do not gloryify violence, drugs, sexual misbehavior, gluttony, jewelry, poor financial decisions, or any other form of ignorance that might be common in commercialized, mainstream hip hop. Instead, these artists focused on positive messages that would uplift the Black community. “Conscious” hip hop artists are thus the exact opposite of the “rappers that report the lies” and become “drugged up full of lies”\nThroughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Stepper Kendrick also discussed the concept of “conciousness” as being free from ego, aware, present in “now”, and connected to the universal or “collective consciousness” as described in the New Age teachings of Eckhart Tolle.\nThe media’s the new religion, you killed the consciousness -“Worldwide Steppers”\n(You really wanna know?) Do you want peace?\n(How I get so low?) Then watch us in the street\n(Only one way to go) One protest for you\n(Higher) Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)\nVladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)\nBut that’s how we all think (Only one way to go)\nThe collective conscious (Higher)\nCalamities on repeat, huh\n-“Savior”\n*Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\n*Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\n-“The Heart Part 5” In some cases the term, “drugged up” or just “drugged” may also be used to describe women (or sometimes men) who have unknowingly consumed a drug that was given to them by a sexual predator who intends to sexually assault or abuse the “drugged” person once they lose awareness or consciousness.\nThe idea of sexual assault could imply that rappers and artists are being “drugged up full of lies” because they are being “fucked over” by the predatory leaders of the entertainment industry. Kendrick previously asserted that artists are getting duped into unfaithful relationships, “fucked over”, and killed by the entertainment industry on the track “N95” from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Stepper.\nThe industry wants\nNiggas and bitches to sleep in a box\nWhile they makin’ a mockery followin’ us\nThis ain’t Monopoly\nWatchin’ for love\nThis ain’t monogamy\nY’all gettin’ fucked The idea of sexual assault could also connect back to Kendrick allegagions of Drake and his crew being sexual predators who traffic girls to sex parties at Drake’s mansion.\nCritical, I know my physical is tested all the time Tested “Critical, I know my physical is tested all the time” \u003e Tested In addition to being spiritually tried, Kendrick is know that he must endure being physically tested. I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride The Sunken Place “I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride” \u003e The “Sunken Place” Here Kendrick talks about being pitiful and in the “Sunken Place”, which is a reference to the movie Get Out.\nIn Get Out a Black male protagonist named Chris goes to visit his white girlfriend’s wealthy family at a secluded estate. Although the family is very friendly—actually too friendly—he begins to notice strange behavior, particularly from the Black woman who serves as housekeeper and the Black man who serves as a groundskeeper.\nOne evening, the Black protagonist has a private conversation with his white girlfriend’s mother. The mother starts asking very probing questions about his personal trauma while using the sound of a spoon stirring around a teacup to hypnotize the Black protagonist.\nAs he talks about his traumatic life experiences the Black protagonist feels pitiful and soon becomes paralyzed and cannot move even though he is still awake. However, then the mother says “Now sink into the floor. Sink!”\nAt that point the Black protagonist’s consciousness becomes totally disconnected or dissociated from his body and sent down to what the mother calls “the sunken place”. In the “sunken place” he faintly see what’s going on around him but is unable to move his body or do anything about it.\nLater on the White mother keeps the Black protagonist in the hypnotized state long enough to strap him to a restraining chair in the basement. The Black protagonist then learns that the family uses the daughter to attract black people and bring them to her family’s estate where they are hypnotized with the consciousness sent to the sunken place. The family then takes over the Black person’s body and transfers the consciousness of older, “degenerate” White person into the Black person’s stolen body stolen body.\nThe protagonists learns that Black woman who is serving as the housekeeper and the Black man who is serving as the groundskeeper are Black people whose bodies were previously stolen so that their consciousness could be replaced by the consciousness of the girlfriend’s grandmother and grandfather respectively.\nThe Black protagonist refuses to be a victim of this plot. He manages to free himself from the restraining chair before his body is stolen and kill several members of the family before escaping from the estate with the help of his Black friend. Kendrick seems to be referencing the plot of Get Out as a metaphor for what the White-owned entertainment industry is doing to Black artists and Black culture.\nThe White owned entertainment industry is sending out corporate White folks to attract Black artists to come join the the White entertainment industry.\nOnce the Black artist is in the building, the White industry folks hypnotize and paralyze Black artists by getting them to keep talking about their traumatic life experiences until they feel pitiful.\nThis is similar to the experiences that Kendrick alluded to on “Mother I Sober” when he rapped:\n“Traded in my tears for a Range Rover” The White industry folk then forces the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness (aka the “Sunken Place”) where they become disconnected and dissociated from what’s going on around them.\nAfter forcing the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness, the White corporate industry folk can then steal the Black artist’s body of work (e.g. the master recording of a music artist) and give it to a degenerate White person to own as his or her own body of work while the Black artist is still trapped in the “Sunken Place”.\nIt is notable that the word “corporate” comes from the Latin word “corporātiō” which literally means “the assumption or taking on of a body”\nThis idea of stealing a Black artist’s body (of work) also mirrors the metaphor of petrification where White corporate industry folk kill the Black artist’s consciousness, penetrate into their body of work, and slowly replace the flexible, organic flesh with rock hard, inflexible, inorganic minerals until the body is just a hard relic of a past life. Kendrick, like the protagonists of Get Out is one of the few Black artists who has been able to regain consciousness, free himself from the restraints of his original contract, and now seems poised to kill the White industry folk so that he can escape before they try to send his consciousness back to the “Sunken Place.”\nPride “I’m pitiful, sunken place soon as I’m question in’ my pride” \u003e Pride It is notable that Kendrick finds himself in the “Sunken Place” whenever he “questions his pride”. The might convey the idea that the entertainment industry wants Kendrick to remain under the influence of his own pride, so that he will make bad decisions and be easier to control.\nKendrick has discussed his internal struggle between pride and humility throughout much of his work.\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\n-“Real”\nLove’s gonna get you killed\nBut pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me\n…\nSick venom in men and women overcome with pride\nA perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies\nPromises are broken and more resentment come alive\nRace barriers make inferior of you and I\nSee, in a perfect world, I’ll choose faith over riches\nI’ll choose work over bitches, I’ll make schools out of prison\nI’ll take all the religions and put ’em all in one service\nJust to tell ’em we ain’t shit, but He’s been perfect, world\n-“PRIDE.”\nBitch, be humble (Hold up, bitch)\nSit down (Hold up, lil’— hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, bitch)\nSit down (Hold up, sit down, lil’— sit down, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBitch, sit down (Hold up, lil’ bitch)\nBe humble (Hold up, bitch)\n-“HUMBLE.”\nI’m chargin’ baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance\nOh, this the part where mental stability meets talent\nOh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice\nTactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues\n-“Father Time”\nWipe my ego, dodge my pride\n(And I’m tripping and falling)\nLook myself in the mirror\nAmityville, ain’t seen nothin’ scarier\n-“Count Me Out” I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time Seeing ghosts “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Seeing ghosts Kendricks spiritual trials and physical tests seem to push him to the point where he is “seeing ghosts.”\nOn “Mother I Sober”, the pivotal track from Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick mentioned seeing the ghost of his maternal grandmother as he struggled to break a generation curse through therapy.\nMy mother’s mother followed me for years in her afterlife\nStarin’ at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night\nLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover Blacking out “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Blacking out The term “blacking out” typically refers to the experience of going into a state of unconsciousness. The idea of unconscioussness connects back to the idea of artists being “drugged up full of lies” as discussed in a previous line. Relapsing “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e Relapsing A “relapse” is a setback in deteriation in someone’s health after previous improvement. The term is most often used to describe the experience in which someone who had previously broken free from an addiction to a drug or stimulating activity returns to their addiction.\nWithin the context of “Watch the Party Die” a “relapsin’ one thought at a time” might imply that the spiritual and physical struggles with the entertainment industry are causing Kendrick to fall back into destructive ways of thought after previously being “drugged up full of lies.”\nIt is notable that throughout Mr. Morale \u0026 the Big Steppers, Kendrick reveals his struggle with sex addition that was exacerbated by being a famous touring artist in the entertainment industry.\nI met her on the third night of Chicago\nNorth America tour, my eyes closed\nFee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model\nDedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible\nEyes light green, penetratin’ the moonlight\nHair done in a bun, energy in the room like\nBig Bang for theory, God, hopin’ you hear me\nPhone off the ringer, tell the world I’m busy\nFair enough, green eyes said her mother didn’t care enough\nSympathize when her daddy in the chain gang\nHer first brother got killed, he was 21\nI was nine when they put Lamont in the grave\nHeartbroken when Estelle didn’t say goodbye\nChad left his body after we FaceTimed\nGreen eyes said you’d be okay, first tour, sex the pain away\nI grieve different\n-“United in Grief”\nAsk Whitney about my lust addiction\nText messagin’ bitches got my thumbs hurt\n…\nSciatica nerve pinch, I don’t know how to feel\nI don’t know how to feel\nLike the first time I fucked a white bitch\nThe first time I fucked a white bitch\nI was sixteen at the Palisades\nFumblin’ my grades, I traveled with the team\nThe apache life, Centennial was like\nWhen Ms. Baker screamed at Doughboy\nMixed that with Purple Rain\nThey interchanged the seams\nHappy just to be out the hood\nWith all the wealthy kids\nCredit cards and family plans\nShe drove her daddy’s Benz\nI found out that he was a sheriff\nThat was a win-win\nBecause he had locked up Uncle Perry\nShe paid her daddy’s sins\nNext time I fucked a white bitch\nWas out in Copenhagen\ngood kid, m.A.A.d city tour\nI flourished on them stages\nWhitney asked did I have a problem\nI said, “I might be racist”\nAncestors watchin’ me fuck was like retaliation\n-“Worldwide Steppers”\nI was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind\nI need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined\nI did it sober sittin’ with myself, I went through all emotions\nNo dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer\nIntoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women\nWhitney’s hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin’ God, “Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?”\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, “Is there an addiction?”\nI said “No,” but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\n… I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin’ manhood\nBut Whitney’s gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could\nAll those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract\n-“Mother I Sober” One thought at a time “I’m seein’ ghosts, blackin’ out, relapsin’ one thought at a time” \u003e One thought at a time Kendrick seems to realize that his susceptibility to addition is fueled by his own pattern of thoughts. This echoes St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians in which he told Chrsitians that they are not fighting a physical battle against other humans but a spiritual battle against arrogant thoughts and arguments that lead to prideful exaltation and prevent humans from knowing God in a loving relationship.\nFor though we walk in the [flesh / body], we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires], for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying arguments and all arrogance that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ.\n-2 Corinthians 10:3-5 I spare no feelings that ain’t mine Spare no feeling “I spare no feelings that ain’t mine” \u003e Spare no feeling The phrase “spare no feelings” describes someone who is acting without any concern of how his or her actions could hurt someone else’s feelings.\nKendrick’s relapse seems to have put him into a mental state where he only cares about his own feelings and no longer cares about the feelings of others. Such a state of mind is the exact opposite of empathy and thus undermines the earlier line when he said “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1”\nKendrick previously expressed his paranoid, troubled and unempathetic state of mind when he was overwhelmed by his feelings on the track “FEEL.” from DAMN..\nI feel like a chip on my shoulders\nI feel like I’m losin’ my focus\nI feel like I’m losin’ my patience\nI feel like my thoughts in the basement\nFeel like, I feel like you’re miseducated\nFeel like I don’t wanna be bothered\nI feel like you may be the problem\nI feel like it ain’t no tomorrow, fuck the world\nThe world is endin’, I’m done pretendin’\nAnd fuck you if you get offended\nI feel like friends been overrated\nI feel like the family been fakin’\nI feel like the feelings are changin’\nFeel like my thought of compromise is jaded\nFeel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it\nFeel like I ain’t feelin’ you all\nFeel like removin’ myself, no feelings involved\nI feel for you, I’ve been in the field for you\nIt’s real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—\nAin’t nobody prayin’ for me\n…\nI feel niggas been out of pocket\nI feel niggas tappin’ they pockets\nI feel like debatin’ on who the greatest can stop it\nI am legend, I feel like all of y’all is peasants\nI feel like all of y’all is desperate\nI feel like all it take is a second to feel like\nMike Jordan whenever holdin’ a real mic\nI ain’t feelin’ your presence\nFeel like I’ma learn you a lesson\nFeel like only me and the music though\nI feel like your feelin’ ain’t mutual\nI feel like the enemy you should know\nFeel like the feelin’ of no hope\nThe feelin’ of bad dope\n…\nI feel like it’s just me\nLook, I feel like I can’t breathe\nLook, I feel like I can’t sleep\nLook, I feel heartless, often off this\nFeelin’ of fallin’, of fallin’ apart with\nDarkest hours, lost it\n..\nI feel like this gotta be the feelin’ where ‘Pac was\nThe feelin’ of an apocalypse happenin’\nBut nothin’ is awkward, the feelin’ won’t prosper\nThe feelin’ is toxic, I feel like I’m boxin’ demons\nMonsters, false prophets schemin’\nSponsors, industry promises\nNiggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton\nChurch, religion, token blacks in bondage\nLawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert\nFuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters\nI can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us\nI can feel it, the dream is more than process\nI can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness\nI can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic\nI feel like sayin’ somethin’, I feel like takin’ somethin’\nI feel like skatin’ off, I feel like waitin’ for ’em\nMaybe it’s too late for ’em\nI feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me? I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean In my feelings “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e In my feelings To be “in one’s feelings” refers to a mental state in which someone is so emotionally dysregulated, overwhelmed or affected that they can no longer think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.\nIt is notable that “In My Feelings” is also the title of Drake’s record-breaking number one single from his 2018 album, Scorpion. On the track, Drake sings and raps about many of his typical themes including his feelings and sexual desire for numerous women.\nTrap, TrapMoneyBenny\nThis shit got me in my feelings*\nGotta be real with it, yeah\nKiki, do you love me? Are you riding?\nSay you’ll never ever leave from beside me\n‘Cause I want ya, and I need ya\nAnd I’m down for you always\nKB, do you love me? Are you riding?\nSay you’ll never ever leave from beside me\n‘Cause I want ya, and I need ya\nAnd I’m down for you always “In My Feelings” also exemplifies how Drake has used social media, influencers and corporate marketing tactics to significantly increase his commercial success. On the same day that the album Scorpion was released, a social media comedian named Shiggy posted a video of him dancing to this chorus. This video soon went viral and was then turned into a the social media #InMyFeelingsChallenge and #KikiChallenge which later added riskier elements like dancing outside of moving cars. These viral trends helped to elevate the track to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart giving Drake the record for most number one hits of rapper in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nSlide “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e Slide Within the context Kendrick’s lyrics “slide” is usually slang for the act of killing someone.\nI said, tell me who you loyal to\nIs it anybody that you would lie for?\nAnybody you would slide for?\nAnybody you would die for?\n-“LOYALTY.”\nEight billion people on Earth, silent murderers\n…\nI caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community\nMy last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies\nNot because the rags in the park had red gradient\nBut because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin’\n-“Worldwide Steppers” By saing “I’m in my feelings when I slide”, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that whenever he tries to kill (aka slide) people, he is only doing so because he is emotionally dysregulated and unable to think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.\nThis line thus gives a whole new perspective and context to “Watch the Party Die”. The whole time that he has been advocating to kill the killers and commit acts of unspeakable violence may really just be evidence that Kendrick is emotionally dysregulated and unable to consider the ramifications or consequences of his words and actions. He seems to have been in a totally “unconscious” state throughout this track.\nBy the same logic, one could also conclude that throughout the battle tracks where Kendrick seemingly tried to kill Drake’s career, Kendrick was “in his feelings” and unable to be empathetic towards Drake.\nA few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” when Kendrick released the track “reincarnated” as the centerpiece of the album GNX , Kendrick seemed to confirm that his actions during the battle with Drake were largely a result of Kendrick being “in his feelings”. On “reincarnated” Kendrick rapped from the perspective of God the Father who told Kendrick that he was a reincarnated version of Lucifer (aka the “devil” / “satan” / “false accusers” / “diabolical one”) who “loved war” and and was kicked out of heaven because his feelings of anxiety led him to do evil. In response, Kendrick acknowledged that all he ever really wanted was to feel “love and approval”.\n\"Son you do well but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\"\nFather I’m not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down\n“But your pride has to die, \"\nOkay father show me how\n“Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for”\nI kept one hundred institutions paid, “Okay, tell me more”\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage, “Okay, tell me more”\nI’m tryna push peace in LA, “But you love war”\nNo, I don’t, “Oh, yes, you do, \" okay then tell me the truth\n“Every individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there’s no forgiveness in your heart?”\nI could tell You where I’m going, “I could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of heaven ‘cause you was anxious\nDidn’t like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth ‘cause you was broken\nRehabilitation not psychosis\nBut now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evil-ish views”\nAnd all I ever wanted from You was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it’s not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI’m using words for inspiration as an ideal\n“So can you promise that you won’t take your gifts for granted?”\nI promise that I’ll use my gifts to bring understanding\n“For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?”\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\n“You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity”\nAnd I’m ashamed that I ever created that enemy Toosie Slide “I’m in my feelings when I slide, I mean” \u003e Toosie Slide In addition to using the word “slide” to refer to killing, on the battle track, “6:16 in LA”, Kendrick used the word “slide” in reference to “Toosie Slide”, Drake’s number one hit and accompanying viral dance trend from 2020.\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\nCan’t Toosie Slide up outta this one, it’s just gon’ resurface\nEvery dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose It is notable that Drake used influencers and viral social media trends to significantly increase the commercial success of “Toosie Slide” in a more enhanced version of his strategy for “In My Feelings” four years earlier.\n“Toosie Slide” was released as a single in April, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns and named after a then 23 year old named Toosie.\nToosie is a Black social media dancer and influencer from Atlanta who had a big break into the music industry when he linked up with fellow Atlanta-native and rapper Future eventually joining Future on the Summer Sixteen Tour with Future, a tour which also features Drake.\nWhen Drake needed another social media dance trend to popularize a new song, he direct messaged Toosie on social media and asked Toosie to make up a dance based on the hook of an unfinished song. That request turned into a modern “Cha Cha Slide”-style dance and viral social media video which featured the song’s hook.\nThe fact that Drake used his connection with Atlanta native rapper, Future, and Future’s Atlanta native dancer, Toosie, also highlights the criticism that Kendrick made on “Not Like Us”. Throughout the third verse of “Not Like Us” Kendrick accused Drake of colonizing Black culture particularly by using Atlanta-based artists to make commercialized hits that could make Drake rich.\nOnce upon a time, all of us was in chains\nHomie still doubled down callin’ us some slaves\nAtlanta was the Mecca, buildin’ railroads and trains\nBear with me for a second, let me put y’all on game\nThe settlers was usin’ townfolk to make ’em richer\nFast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer After Toosie’s video had already gone viral Drake released the official music video for the full song which was now titled “Toosie Slide”. The video showed Drake wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask and doing Toosi’s dance while going through a tour of his mansion during the COVID lockdown.\nOn the surface, “Toosie Slide” seems like just a dance song with melodies.\nBaby, don’t you wanna dance with me? No?\nI could dance like Michael Jackson\nI could give you satisfaction\nAnd you know we out here every day with it\nI’ma show you how to get it\n…\nIt go right foot up, left foot, slide\nLeft foot up, right foot, slide\nBasically, I’m sayin’, either way, we ‘bout to slide, ayy\nCan’t let this one slide, ayy (Who’s bad?) However, if one pays close attention to the lyrics one can hear that Drake is actually trying to “act tough” and portay himself as a “street nigga” as he uses the word “slide” to simultaneously refer to the dance and to the act of vengefully killing his enemies.\nGot so many opps, I be mistakin’ opps for other opps\nGot so many people that I love out of troubled spots\nOther than the family I got, it’s either you or me\nThat’s just how I think, it’s either you or me\nThis life got too deep for you, baby\nTwo or three of us about to creep where they stayin’\n…\nBlack leather glove, no sequins\nBuckles on the jacket, it’s Alyx shit\nNike crossbody, got a piece in it\nGot a dance, but it’s really on some street shit\nI’ma show you how to get it* It is notable that on the battle track “euphoria” Kendrick says that he would like Drake to keep making songs with catchy melodies that make everyone dance instead of trying to “act tough”. Kendrick even implied that if Drake focused on making dance songs, Kendrick would have no reason to threaten Drake with diss songs.\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don’t like Drake when he act tough\n…\nStill love when you see success, everything with me is blessed\nKeep makin’ me dance, wavin’ my hand, and it won’t be no threat At the end of the battle track “Not Like Us”, Kendrick also seems to mock Drake’s attempt to make viral dance hits like “Toosie Slide” by chanting the following dance instructions:\nLet me hear you say, “OV-ho” (OV-ho)\nSay, “OV-ho” (OV-ho)\nThen step this way, step that way\nThen step this way, step that way Also on the video for “Not Like Us”, there is scene where Kendrick is standing on a dark street. Just behinda Kendrick, a menacing man approaches wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask just like Drake did in the “Toosie Slide” video. However, before the man has a chance to put a hand on Kendrick the man is suddenly thrown backwards almost as if there was some kind of supernatural force protecting Kendrick.\nAll of these references to “Toosie Slide” along with the slang meaning of “slide” seem to suggest that Drake’s actions over a number of years are the exact things that Kendrick has judged to be punishable by execution throughout “Watch the Party Die”.\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do Lecrae “A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do” \u003e Lecrae Kendrick transitions away from discussion on his spiritual, physical and emotional trials withing the entertainment industry and once again wonders out loud what Lecrae would do as a Black man and a hip hop artist who has faced many similar trials and challenges.\nIt is notable that instead of saying “I wonder what Lecrae would do\", he now says “a nigga wonder what Lecrae would do\", almost as if it is a question that any Black person should be wondering.\nFor context, Lecrae has had to deal with his fair share of public controversy and conflict with White Christians who began to take offense at Lecrae when after Lecdrated started speaking about racial justice issues that were affecting the Black community.\nBecause White (Evangelical) Christians represent the largest consumer demographic for Christian hip hop, speaking out about racial justice put Lecrae at odds with the White -wned entertainment industry who wanted to co-opt his music and act like they owned him. Lecraes details these dynamics on several tracks on Lecrae’s 2017 album All Things Work Together for Good.\nLearned a lot over these last few years\nIndustry people ain’t friends, just peers\n…\nStill killin’ over colors, now it’s black and blue\nWe dyin’ every day, B, we just don’t make the news\nWhen you speak out for your race, just watch\nThey gon’ twist and say you hate these cops\nI’ma take these shots\nHow can he love Jesus, Kanye, and K-Dot?\nMartin, Malcolm, and Schaeffer, Mitsubishi, and Maybach?\nContradictory, nah, it’s complimentary\nUnderstanding me ain’t for the simple and elementary, oh\n-“Always Knew” People wonder, “Is he woke or just a new slave?”\nOld religion, he just covered it with new chains\nChoppin’ out the church, he ain’t real, he fake\nHe divisive, he don’t rep the King, he just want the fame\nAw man, now they actin’ like I’m suddenly political\nTold me shut my mouth and get my checks from Evangelicals\nBoy, my momma raised me, on Angela and Eldridge\nChuck Berry made it, but the credit went to Elvis\nKnow you never knew that, know you think I’m too black\nI just think I’m too real, I grew up on 2Pac\nYou grew up thinkin’ that the Panthers was some terrorists\nI grew up hearin’ how they fed my momma eggs and grits\n\"‘Crae, they say you should follow in the steps of King\"\nI say, “You’ve forgotten how they shot him in the streets”\nI ain’t really changed, it’s the same old rebel\nStill a radical, I’m passionate, it’s just another level (leggo!)\nAT told me I should fight back\nThey don’t like that (they don’t)\nJust know if you rock the boat you better have a life raft (what?)\n…\nNow these people swear they own me, sendin’ out threats\nTold me keep my mouth shut, told me be a Stepin Fetchit\nI will not oblige to your colonized way of faith\nMy Messiah died for the world, not just USA\nThey say, “Jesus was Conservative”\nTell ’em, “That’s a lie”\nNo, He not a Liberal either if you think I’ll choose a side\nThey say, “‘Crae, you so divisive, shouldn’t be a black church”\nI say, “Do the math, segregation started that first!”\nHey, you want unity?

(Interlude)”, “King Kunta”, “These Walls”, “For Sale?”, “Complexion (A Zulu Love)”, “Complexion (A Zulu Love)”, “untitled 05|09.21.2014”, and “Loyalty”.\nGiven how much he has witnessed Kendrick creative process up close over multiple years and projects, Terrance Martin would know more than most people that Kendrick’s mind is always thinking on multiple layers while trying to give truth to the youth.\nI flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues Flood the market “I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues” \u003e Flood the market “Flooding the market” refers to the act of releasing a large quantity of a particular product into the a particular market in a short period of time.\nFor Kendrick, flooding the market could refer to the release of the current track and a subsequent album which would flood the music market with sales and streams. The idea of “streaming” music also connects to the theme of water introduced by the word “flood”. I paid your dues “I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues” \u003e I paid your dues The idea of a market where people pay for goods and services also connects to the idea of “paying dues”. “Paying dues” a phrase that refers working hard with a great deal of patience, endurance and commitment to the little things in order to earn respect and an opportunity to take on a much larger or more visible role.\nWhile rapping from Nispey’s perspective on “The Heart Part 5”, Kendrick uses the phrase “paid dues” to describe the hard work that Nipsey Hussle put into the rap game by releasing 13 mixtapes in 12 years from 2005 to 2017 before releasing his only studio album in 2018.\nReflectin’ on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums By saying “I paid your dues”, Kendrick would seem to be talking to someone who did not work hard to earn respect. This could be a reference to Drake, whom Kendrick has repeatedly criticized for using ghostwriters to write his rap lyrics instead of putting in the work to write his own lyrics.\nSimilarly , on “euphoria” and “meet the grahams”, Kendrick criticized Drake for receiving Ozempic weight loss injection, having abdominal surgery to improve his appearance without needing to pay his dues by working out.\nYeah, my first one like my last one, it’s a classic, you don’t have one\nLet your core audience stomach that, then tell ’em where you get your abs from\n-“euphoria”\nEven if it don’t benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline\nDon’t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did\nDon’t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership\n-“meet the grahams” By saying “paid your dues”, Kendrick could also be saying that Drake never did the hard, therapeutic work of self-examination to understand how he needs to grow and mature. This lack of self-examination left Kendrick to do the examination work for Drake, which resulted in the astute criticisms that Kendrick made throughout all the battle tracks.\nAnd so it’s up, if you ain’t one of ours, it’s bad news It’s up “And so it’s up, if you ain’t one of ours, it’s bad news” \u003e Ain’t one of ours By saying “it’s up”, Kendrick could be indicating that the “time is up”, which would connect back to the first line of each verse which said “It’s time to watch the party die”.\nKendrick asserts that the death of “the party” will be bad news to those who “ain’t one of ours”.\nUsing the phrase “ain’t one of ours” to refer to people outside of the community or outside of the circle of trust mirrors the core mesage of the battle track “Not Like Us” where Kendrick mentions Drake and the members of Drake’s crew by name prior to the chorus where Kenrick repeatedly said “They not like us.” My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up Jay Estrada fitness “My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up” \u003e Jay Estrada fitness Kendrick’s hometown friend, Jay (or Jason) Estrada is Compton-native athletic fitness trainer who worked as a strength trainer for the 2016 U.S.A. Olympic basketball teams. Additionally, Jay Estrada has also trained other NBA players including Compton-native DeMar Derozan, who made a guest appearance in the “Not Like Us” video after Kendrick name dropped him in the second verse of “Not Like Us”.\nBy working out with Jay Estrada, Kendrick is again showing himself to be someone who pays his own dues in contrast to Drake who allegedly paid for for the shortcut of Ozempic and abdominal surgery based on Kendrick’s words to Drake’s son on “meet the grahams”.\nEven if it don’t benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline\nDon’t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did\nDon’t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership It is notable, that Kendrick’s advice to Drake’s son to “do some push-ups” is a direct response to “Push Ups”, Drake’s initial diss track where Drake mocked Kendrick for a viral social media video which shoed Kendrick doing push-ups in a park. Drake used the image of Kendrick doing push-ups as a metaphor for Kendrick getting coerced into a disadvantageous financial situation by Top Dawg, the Black owner of Kendrick’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Drake asserted that every time Top Dawg told Kendrick to “drop” (i.e. drop to the ground as a metaphor for dropping an album), Kendrick had to give Top Dawg “fifty” (i.e. fifty push ups as a metaphor for 50% of the royalties from Kedrick’s music releases).\nExtortion baby, whole career, you been shook up\n‘Cause Top told you, “Drop and give me fifty,” like some push-ups, huh\n…\nPull your contract ‘cause we gotta see the split\nThe way you doin’ splits, bitch, your pants might rip\nYou better do that motherfuckin’ show inside the bity\nMaroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty\nThen we need a verse for the Swifties\nTop say drop, you better drop and give ’em fifty\n…\nAyy, better drop and give me fifty, ayy\nDrop and give me fifty, drop and give me fifty, ayy From Kendrick’s perspective, by choosing to mock Kendrick for doing push up exercise and working hard for Top Dawg, Drake is exposing himself as someone who would rather cheat and sell himself to the White owned entertainment industry instead of working hard to pay his dues. In Katt William’s viral Club Shay Shay interview that Kendrick alluded to on “meet the grahams”, Katt Wiliams made the exact same point against comics and entertainers who sold out to the White owned entertainment industry used ghostwriters and did not pay their dues or otherwise gave up on working hard. Katt Williams compared these people to athletes or body builders who use performance enhancing drugs to avoid putting in the hard work of exercising but still want people to impressed with their bodies.\nI’m a standup comedian. This is my nineteenth one-hundred city tour. I’m not going to have a conversation with these lazy bums that’ll take a shortcut at any point. Yes, it’s easier for you to juice than to get in the gym, but you don’t get to bring that body in here talking crazy talk about how good you look. Burn it down to build it up “My nigga Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up” \u003e Burn it down to build it up “You gotta burn it down to build it up” would seem to be a statement that Jay Estrada would make in the context of strength and fitness training.\nIn order to build stronger muscles, an athlete first has to break down the existing muscle by lifting, pressing or pulling weights or some other kind of resistance. These kinds of exercises create tiny microtears in muscle fibers that are accompanied by a burning sensation in the muscles. This burning sensation is what is being referred to by the exercise term “feel the burn”.\nThe idea of “burn it down to build it up” could be applied to much of the violent language that Kendrick has used when acting like a totalitarian dictator who is trying to purge society and “burn the whole village” so “we can start over” with the hope of building a “new earth”.\nAt the same time, if we see Kendrick’s fierce criticism and exposure of Drake as a way to “burn it down to build it up”, the natural conclusion is that Kendrick actually wants Drake to be built up into a better person.\nThis act of “tough love” is consistent with Kendrick’s words on “meet the grahams” where he explained his motives for engaging in a rap battle with Drake.\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin’ I wanted to crash your party\nBut truthfully, I don’t have a hatin’ bone in my body\n…\nThirty-seven, but you showin’ up as a seven-year-old\nYou got gamblin’ problems, drinkin’ problems, pill-poppin’ and spendin’ problems\nBad with money, whorehouse\nSolicitin’ women problems, therapy’s a lovely start\nBut I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom\nI try to empathize with you ‘cause I know that you ain’t been through nothin’\nCrave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it’s puzzlin’\nNo dominance, let’s recap moments when you didn’t fit in\nNo secret handshakes with your friend\nNo culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin’ your mother\nIdentity’s on the fence, don’t know which family will love ya\nThe skin that you livin’ in is compromised in personas\nCan’t channel your masculine even when standin’ next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon’ hide them baby mamas, ain’t ya?\nYou embarrassed of ’em, that’s not right, that ain’t how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside Trust “Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside” \u003e Trust The phrase “locked in” is most often used to describe someone who is focused on their goal, which connects to the themes of paying dues and working out in the previous lines. Here Kendrick says he is focused on (i.e. locked in to) “what he trusts”.\nIt is notable that Kendrick’s rap battle with Drake started when Kendrick was featured on the song “Like That” on Future and Metro Boomin’s album titled, We Don’t Trust You. That album title seems to have been a statement about Drake, who the two Atlanta-native artists had previously worked with but no longer trusted.\nThroughout the battle, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being an actor, manipulator and liar who cannot be trusted.\nThe famous actor we once knew is lookin’ paranoid and now spiralin’\nYou’re movin’ just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin’ distasteful\nI calculate you’re not as calculated, I can even predict your angle\nFabricating stories on the family front ‘cause you heard Mr. Morale\nA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now\nYou’re not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\nTommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection\nI make music that electrify ’em, you make music that pacify ’em\nI can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that’s random acts of kindness\nKnow you a master manipulator and habitual liar too\nBut don’t tell no lie about me and I won’t tell truths ‘bout you\n-“euphoria”\nI think somebody lyin’\nSmell somebody lyin’\nI don’t see no fire\n…\nYeah, somebody’s lyin’, I could see the vibes on Ak’\n-“6:16 in LA”\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what’s under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin’ to believe in\n‘Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on ’em, I know they all got you in ’em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that’s out there hopin’ that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\n-“meet the grahams”\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\n…\nThe settlers was usin’ townfolk to make ’em richer\nFast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a check balance\nLet me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge\nYou called Future when you didn’t see the club (Ayy, what?)\nLil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)\n21 gave you false street cred\nThug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)\nQuavo said you can be from Northside (What?)\n2 Chainz say you good, but he lied\nYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars\nNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer\nThe family matter and the truth of the matter\nIt was God’s plan to show y’all the liar\n-“Not Like Us” Outside “Lockin’ in to what I trust, lookin’ outside” \u003e Outside Since Kendrick does trust Drake he looks “outside” to find what he does trust. Here “outside” seems to refer to the world around Kendrick, or maybe more specifically the city around him—the city of Compton.\nThe association with the city of Compton being “outside” seems to be highlighted on “Not Like Us” where in quick succession Kendrick mentions Drake—the liar and false god, who need to be locked inside (a jail cell)—in contrast to the city that is free to be outside.\nDevil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy\nFreaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy\nRoll they ass up like a fresh pack of ‘za, ayy\nCity is back up, it’s a must, we outside, ayy The music video of “Not Like Us” further emphisizes the contrast between the city of Compton being free outside with numerous shots of large crowds filling the plaza of the Compton City Hall and Civic Center while Drake’s OVO owl is locked up inside a birdcage. Notably, the owl in the birdcage is shown in the second to last shot right before the video cuts back a final shot of the large crowd dancing at the Compton City Hall and Civic Center under a sculture dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr..\nThe kids live tomorrow ‘cause today, the party just died Kids “The kids live tomorrow ‘cause today, the party just died” \u003e Kids Kendrick ends that song by declaring that at some point between the beginning and end of this song, Kendrick has watched the party die, likely as a result of Kendrick’s execution orders.\nIn contrast to the party—which will not go on tomorrow—,Kendrick highlights the kids who are now able to live tomorrow.\nThe mention of kids is likely a reference to Kendrick’s allegation that Drake and his crew were trafficking underaged girls to for Drake and his crew to have sex with at parities. At the same time, uncompromising artists such as Katt Williams has sought to expose that powerful men engaging in predatory sexual behavior is a widespread, endemic problem throughout the entertainment industry.\nThe future for kids has been a central focus for Kendrick since he became a father as can be seen throughout Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper’s theme of breaking generational curses - particularly curses that related to sexual abuse.\nPlayin’ “Baby Shark” with my daughter\nWatchin’ for sharks outside at the same time\nLife as a protective father, I’d kill for her\nMy son Enoch is the part two\nWhen I expire, my children’ll make higher valleys\nIn this present moment, I saw that through\n-“Worldwide Steppers”\nEnoch, your father’s just detoxed, my callin’ is right on time\n…\nUzi, your father’s in deep meditation\nMy spirit’s awakened, my brain is asleep\n-“Mr. Morale”\nFamily ties, they accused my cousin, “Did he touch you, Kendrick?”\nNever lied, but no one believed me when I said “He didn’t”\n…\n“Did he touch you?” I said “No” again, still they didn’t believe me\n…\nI asked my momma why she didn’t believe me when I told her “No”\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I’m sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn’t agree\nNow I’m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver ‘cause I’m nervous\n…\nI pray our children don’t inherit me and feelings I attract\nA conversation not bein’ addressed in Black families\nThe devastation, hauntin’ generations and humanity\nThey raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters\nThen they made us watch, then made us rape each other\nPsychotic torture between our lives, we ain’t recovered\nStill livin’ as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance\nEvery other brother has been compromised\nI know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused\nI see ’em daily buryin’ they pain in chains and tattoos\nSo listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move\nLearn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school\nHis anger grows deep in misogyny\nThis is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active\nSo I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made\nSo I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame\nSo I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother’s pain\nI hope Hykeem made you proud ‘cause you ain’t die in vain\nSo I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all\nSo I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God\nSo I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred\nAs I set free all you abusers, this is transformation\n… [Whitney Alford]\nYou did it, I’m proud of you\nYou broke a generational curse\nSay “Thank you, dad”\nThank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother\n-“Mother I Sober” “Die for the Party” by Lecrae [Verse] I was wrestlin’ like, should I write a verse? Should I write a verse? “I was wrestlin’ like, should I write a verse?” \u003e Should I write a verse? Lecrae’s track “Die for the Party” features the exact same beat as Kendrick Lamar’s “Watch the Party Die”. As Lecrae mentions here, “Die for the Party” is meant to serve as an additional verse for “Watch the Party Die”.\nLecrae decided to release this verse on his own rather than Kendrick inviting him to do so as part of a remix or extended version. That being said, on two separate lines within the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick did say that he wondered “what Lecrae would do”.\nSometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do\nFuck these niggas up or show ’em just what prayer do?\n…\nA nigga wonder what Lecrae would do Lecrae thus seems to have reasonably concluded that those two lines from “Watch the Party Die” were an open invitation for him to write and release his verse on “Die for the Party”.\nThe culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth Culture vultures “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Culture vultures Lecrae here makes a reference to the Jay-Z’s classic and often quoted lines from the 2001 track “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” where Kendricks challenges the status quo of the music industry.\nI do this for my culture, to let ’em know\nWhat a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster\nShow ’em how to move in a room full of vultures\nIndustry shady, it need to be taken over\nLabel owners hate me, I’m raisin’ the status quo up\nI’m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush\nPay us like you owe us for \u0026\u0026all the years that you hoed us*\nWe can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks* Recall that on the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick also makes a subtle reference to these exact lines from “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)”.\nSay hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores\nYou let ’em snack, they eat your face, the signatures is bein’ forged Clout chasing “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Clout chasing In slang, the phrase “clout-chasing” is used to describe a person who seeks attention, fame, or influence, often by engaging in behavior that attracts public interest or aligns that themself with popular trends or influential figures.\nIn many cases, rappers are accused of “clout-chasing” when they directly name more famous hip hop artists in order to associate themselves with more famous artist without actually being invited to collaborate with the such famous artist.\n“Clout chasers” can be seen as a form of “culture vulture” since “clout chasers” are metaphorically scavenging off of someone else who has been “killing it” rather than using their own skills, discipline or hard work to eat what they kill. Thus, “clout chasing” is also a way for someone to avoid “paying dues” or working hard, as Kendrick mentioned in the first verse.\nIt is notable that on the battle track “THE HEART PART 6”, Drake accused Kendrick of “clout chasing” as Drake denied Kendrick’s allegations that Drake was involved in pedophilia and sex trafficing.\nAlbum droppin’ soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser ‘stead of doin’ hard labor Prove their worth “The culture got enough clout-chasin’ vultures out here tryna prove they worth” \u003e Prove their worth Lecrae suggests that “culture vulture” rappers turn to “clout-chasing” in order to “prove their worth”. This psychological need to prove one’s own worth through success as a rapper is a vice with which Lecrae has personally struggled even as he is learning to find his identity in who God made him to be.\nDuring Lecrae’s own The Deep End podcast episode where he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake, Lecrae concluded that the main problem with the battle was that both rappers were trying to tear down their rival in order to obtain a false sense of value and worth.\nIt becomes a problem when your identity is on the line a war trying to tear down someone’s identity it’s not me trying to best you to show you you’re fake and I’m real it’s not me trying to best you to show you that I’m superior to you and that is the ultimate problem with finding our worth in what we do. What we tend to do is find the quality of our work as the quality of our worth and I think that’s a lot of what we’re seeing between these guys which I think is so unhealthy because at the end of the day you’re in order to be great you’ve got to have someone less than you—that you got to have someone to step on in order for you to have value and worth. If we’re talking about the quality of our work—if your identity is shaped by what you do and being the best at it, then you got to step on someone else to prove that you are worthy of whatever it is you say you are.\nSo, at the end of the day, I think the real battle is between whenever you make anything like your ability or your body or your looks a part of your identity, they’ll ultimately begin to crush you. Those things are going to crush you because they’ve got to always measure up. When they don’t measure up, now your identity and your value are worthless.\nSo I wouldn’t be surprised if internally Drake is feeling a sense of worthlessness … I wouldn’t be surprised if he has to go look at the things he’s done to remind himself of his worth.\nI remember when I was in high school, and in high school, my value was being the dope rapper. … And here comes Steve from Brooklyn. He’s kicking metaphors and similes and bars and references. I was just destroyed. And because of that, my value was now in question. My identity, my worth, was in question.\nSo what did I do? I had two choices: I could either run away from him so that I could maintain some semblance of value, or I could associate with him so I could regain some sense of value. Now, the good news is, I became a better rapper. The bad news is that all it did was reignite a false sense of self-worth and identity, to where, fast forward, I’m writing a song about identity because I’m still wrestling with that reality.\nAnd God already told me I mattered. He told me in scripture. I mean, the creator of creation Himself knows me by name, and I’m still fighting. I’m still fighting for a false sense of identity.\nThey need attention\nThey can't imagine me not tryna make myself look bigger\noff of this Kendrick mention subsection “line” \u003e subsection Foo Bar ",

<ul>
<li>
<p>“Watch the Party Die” was the first track that Kendrick released after Kendrick’s battle with Aubrey Graham who is better known by his middle name Drake. It is thus notable that on the fourth verse of the battle track “meet the grahams” Kendrick refers to Drake’s party seemingly as a larger metaphor for Drake’s current way of life.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dear <strong>Aubrey</strong><br>
I know you probably thinkin&rsquo; I wanted to <strong>crash your party</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first line of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; thus seems to be subtly alluding to Kendrick&rsquo;s battle with Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the battle tracks that Kendrick released, “meet the grahams” is notable for being the track where Kendrick dropped bombshell allegations of Drake being a pedophile.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra, sit down, what I&rsquo;m about to say is heavy, now listen<br>
Mm-mm, your son&rsquo;s a sick man with sick thoughts, <strong>I think niggas like him should die</strong><br>
<strong>Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life</strong><br>
He <strong>hates Black women, hypersexualizes &rsquo;em with kinks of a nympho fetish</strong><br>
Grew facial hair because he understood bein&rsquo; a beard just fit him better<br>
<strong>He got sex offenders on ho-VO</strong> that he keep on a monthly allowance<br>
A <strong>child should never be compromised</strong> and he keepin&rsquo; his child around them<br>
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin&rsquo; <strong>there&rsquo;s predators like him lurkin&rsquo;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>They be streamlinin&rsquo; victims all inside of they home</strong> and callin&rsquo; &rsquo;em tender<br>
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong><br>
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away<br>
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away<br>
They lookin&rsquo; at you too if you standin&rsquo; by him, keep the family away<br>
I&rsquo;m <strong>lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In these lyrics from &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo;, Kendrick asserts that sexual predators like Drake or Harvey Weinstein should die, much like the party in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also recounts a message from Black comedian, Katt Williams that encouraged listeners to seek out “the truth”. Here, Kendrick is alluding to Katt Williams’ viral interview which was released by Club Shay Shay podcast on January 3, 2024, just a few days into the new year. Throughout that interview, Katt Williams assumed the role of a truth-teller and repeatedly exposed the economic and moral corruption of the entertainment industry. In particular, Katt Williams revealed a deeply entrenched pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse, and coercion by which powerful men in the entertainment industry routinely take advantage of less powerful people in the entertainment industry. Katt Williams specifically named Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Diddy as men engaged in these predatory practices.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Years before the interview, R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein had already been convicted of several severe sexual offences and been given lengthy prison sentences. It was thus notable that Katt Williams included Diddy along with these two men since at the time Diddy was facing numerous civil lawsuits that accused him of sexual assaut but had yet to be charged with any criminal offense. Nonetheless, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=iKsx-nqFoDQbiOnu&amp;t=940">interview (15:40 - 16:32)</a> Katt Williams predicted that 2024 would be a year when the truth about men who behaved like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly would come to light.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I came in this business saying I was going to expose</strong>. When I talked about Michael Jackson, when I talked about R. Kelly they canceled me for these things because “why would you talk about another black dude?” Race is not where the line is drawn. <strong>It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s side and the other side</strong> and we don&rsquo;t care nothing about the other side - period. Period. <strong>All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024</strong>. It&rsquo;s up for all of them. <strong>It don&rsquo;t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is</strong>. TD Jakes - any of them the every…<strong>All lies will be exposed</strong>. That&rsquo;s all and anyone who takes that the wrong way - know why they take it the wrong way. <strong>The truth is the light</strong>.<br>
&hellip;<br>
All people that love the truth got to be happy if <strong>the truth coming out and lies is getting exposed. That&rsquo;s just what time it is - 2024</strong>, folks.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&amp;t=6033">interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)</a>, Katt Williams also specifically highlighted how he had been invited to Diddy&rsquo;s parties and even though attending these parties might lead to financially lucrative opportunities he consistently refused to attend the parties because he was convinced that he would be exploited and coerced into performing sexual acts for Diddy or other powerful men at one of Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked the penis</strong>. That was my only goal.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve had to turn down $50 million four times</strong> - four times - just <strong>to protect my integrity and that virgin hole</strong> I was telling you about, right. Cause <strong>P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong> You&rsquo;ve got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I did.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence by saying “I think <strong>it’s time</strong> to watch the party die” in September of 2024, Kendrick seems to be agreeing with - or maybe fulfilling - Katt Williams’ prediction that “All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024” and “It’s up for all of them”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, the idea that it is almost &ldquo;time&rdquo; for the criminal offences of Drake and his crew will soon be exposed is exactly what Kendrick first said on &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; when he predicted a police raid on Drake&rsquo;s mansion, which is nicknamed &ldquo;The Embassy&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Katt Williams said, &ldquo;Get you the truth,&rdquo;</strong> so I&rsquo;ma get mines<br>
<strong>The Embassy &lsquo;bout to get raided too, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after releasing “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick would go on to release the album <em>GNX</em> featuring the opening track “wacced out murals” where Kendrick again mentions Katt Williams and warns those on the “other side” that truth is about to be exposed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
Exterminate &rsquo;em right now<br>
<strong>Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth &lsquo;bout to get loud</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should also be noted that Kendrick was not the first person to specifically accuse Drake of unreported sexual misconduct and pedophilia. Numerous people within the entertainment industry and on social media had made similar, though less widely publicized allegations.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, social media users became suspicious after the video release of a 2018 red carpet interview where a then 14 year old actress named Millie Bobby Brown told a reporter that she had a very emotionally affectionate relationship with a then 31 year old Drake. Her account of the relationship included revelations that they text frequently including Drake sending a message that said “I miss you so much” to which she replied “I miss you more”. She also mentioned that Drake helps her with advice about boys and talked about how excited she was about her plans to see him during a trip he had planned to Atlanta.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year later, in 2019, roughly 5 years before the battle with Kendrick, on a podcast episode that was discussing R. Kelly, a White comedian named Shane Gillis directly alleged that Drake “likes &rsquo;em young” and predicted that Drake was going to get exposed and arrested in the next 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Dude R. Kelly got away”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;That reminds me I do want to say this. I want to be on the record. Drake… Drake&rsquo;s gonna be …he&rsquo;s on that R. Kelly tip.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
“You think so?”<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Drizzy <strong>Drake likes &rsquo;em young</strong>. He does. It&rsquo;s somewhat known already but this is one of those things where I want to you know you got to say something. Like remember Louie that whole thing, yeah, and like, we knew about that yeah and we were just like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; Drake, Drizzy <strong>Drake is into the young ones</strong>. <strong>He&rsquo;s going to get got in the next 5 years</strong>, unfortunately. Love me some Drizzy Drake.&rdquo;</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to have directly referenced this Shane Gillis podcast episode and the quote “Drake likes ’em young” during the first verse of the battle track “Not Like Us”. In that verse, Kendrick also refers to “the party” where a member of Drake’s OVO record label crew named PARTYNEXTDOOR allegedly goes to snort cocaine.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Say, <strong>Drake, I hear you like &rsquo;em young</strong><br>
You better not ever go to cell block one<br>
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The pedophelia allegations on “Not Like Us” culminate with Kendrick repeatedly calling Drake a “69 god” in reference to the act of simultaneous oral sex due to the fact that a 6 looks like a 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Devil is a lie, he a 69 God</strong>, ayy<br>
&hellip;<br>
The family matter and the truth of the matter<br>
<strong>It was God&rsquo;s plan to show y&rsquo;all the liar</strong><br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a<br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
<strong>Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 god</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong><br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <strong>run for your life</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association with simultaneous oral sex is due to the fact that the number 6 looks like a number 9 that has been rotated 180 degrees<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from the number 69 being an obvious reference to simultaneous oral sex, it is notable that in the New Testament the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;, &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; or &ldquo;liar&rdquo; ) - also known as the &ldquo;satan&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;adversary&rdquo;) - is often depicted as a figure who unlike God cannot actually create anything. Instead the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; will take things that have been created by the one true God and uses lies to twist or turn them upside down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his viral Club Shay Shay interview (20:51 - 21:35), Katt Williams also made the point that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; cannot create anything but can only use lies to twist the things that God has created.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>These people are not powerful. <strong>Satan can&rsquo;t create anything</strong> that includes blessings for his people. That&rsquo;s why you know what the number one job of somebody that sold their soul in Hollywood is? Is to act like it didn&rsquo;t happen. They all do the same job.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In English the verb “pervert” is often used to refer to the way that the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; or someone who behaves like the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; uses lies to twist the truth and turn a good thing towards an evil purpose. The word &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; is derived from the Latin word “perverto” which means “to turn thoroughly”. Someone who habitually &ldquo;perverts&rdquo; good things can themselves be refered to with the noun &ldquo;pervert&rdquo;. Notably, Kendrick refered to Drake as a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; on &ldquo;meet the graham&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; to shoot through any <strong>pervert</strong> that lives, keep the family safe</em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the inversion between the numbers 6 and 9 can be seen as a symbol for the “satanic” way that Drake - the self-proclaimed “6 god” - has allegedly perverted “God’s Plan”, in reference to Drake&rsquo;s hit single.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; is to twist and pervert the truth enough to convince humans to empower themselves to enjoy illicit pleasure and “become like God”. This pattern of lying is first depicted when the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; takes on the form of snake which deceives the prototypical man and woman to eat the fruit from a forbidden tree so that they can become like God.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now <strong>the snake was more shrewd</strong> than any animal of the field which the LORD God had made. And he <strong>said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?</strong>”<br>
 <br>
The woman said to the snake, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but <strong>from the fruit of the tree</strong> which is in the middle of the garden, <strong>God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die</strong>.’”<br>
 <br>
The snake said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and <strong>you will become like God</strong>, knowing good and evil.”<br>
 <br>
When the <strong>woman saw that the tree</strong> was good for food, and that it <strong>was a delight to the eyes</strong>, and that the tree <strong>was desirable</strong> to make one wise, <strong>she took some of its fruit and ate</strong>; and she also <strong>gave some to her husband with her, and he ate</strong>.</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Kendrick&rsquo;s allegations against Drake, the forbidden fruit would seem to reprsent illicit sexual behavior with underage girls.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Since the forbidden fruit and the number 69 can refer to a sexual acts, Kendrick seems to depicting Drake as a “sex god”. In ancient times, sex gods such as Ishtar, Ashtar, Ba’al, Aphrodite, Venus, Eros, Cupid, Dionysus, Bacchus and Liber were worshiped throughout the world including the Roman Empire and the Ancient Near East where most of the events of the Bible take place.<br>
 </li>
<li>In many cases, those who worshiped sex gods would go to temple buildings where well-to-do men would come to have ritualized sex with male and female temple prostitutes who were essentially slaves that were owned by the temple.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the Roman Empire, temple feasts such as the Bacchanalia were parties where men would engage in excessive drinking, violence and sexual initiation of male and female minors. These parties were considered so wild and  destructive to societal order that the Roman government almost banned them before eventually imposing strict reforms.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence from the ancient context of sex gods and the reference to Drake being a “69 god”, the “party” that Kendrick mentions here could be seen as a modern equivalent of a ancient sex god party where men come to have sex with minors who have been trafficked into prostitution.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After the release of &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;, Drake released “The Heart Part 6” where Drake publicly denied the pedophelia allegations and tried to shift the focus to Kendrick&rsquo;s own family trauma through a misreading of Kendrick&rsquo;s track &ldquo;mother i sober&rdquo; from <strong>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</strong>. The release of “The Heart Part 6” effectively ended the battle between Kendrick and Drake.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be asserting that &ldquo;the party&rdquo; has become become so wicked that even if the people who are hosting or attending &ldquo;the party&rdquo; have a change of heart and decide to apologize, society should not accept their apology.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s accusations of wickedness could be directed at the pedophile parties which Kendrick alleges that Drake has been hosting. The accusations could also be directed at Diddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freak Off&rdquo; sex parties which came to light earlier in the year when Diddy was charged with sex trafficing, recketeering transportation to engage in prostitution. Still, Kendrick could be making his accusations more broadly at countless exploitative entertainment parties hosted by powerful men in the entertainment industry as exposed by Katt Williams.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that that the concept of “wickedness” was a major theme of Kendrick’s album <em>DAMN.</em>. The album&rsquo;s opening track, &ldquo;BLOOD.&rdquo; begins with the with an ominous voice which that says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it <strong>wickedness</strong> or is it <strong>weakness</strong>?<br>
You decide. Are we going to <strong>live</strong> or <strong>die</strong>?”</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout <em>DAMN.</em> Kendrick seems to present a dichotomous choice between the &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; that is routinely perpetrated by poweful, violent men in this world and the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; that was exhibited by Jesus who refused to use violence against his enemies and then laid down his life to be crucified in the place of violent men.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Love&rsquo;s gonna get you killed<br>
But pride&rsquo;s gonna be the death of you, and you and me</em><br>
-&ldquo;PRIDE.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Damn, love or lust<br>
Damn, all of us</em><br>
-&ldquo;LOVE&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>Hail Mary, <strong>Jesus</strong>, and Joseph<br>

<strong>Homicidal thoughts</strong>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>

But <strong>is America honest or do we bask in sin?</strong></em><br>

 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; creativity<br>

I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear of losin&rsquo; loyalty from pride<br>
&lsquo;Cause my DNA won&rsquo;t let me involve in the light of God<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that my humbleness is gone<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, fear that love ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; here no more<br>
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fear, <strong>fear that it&rsquo;s wickedness or weakness</strong><br>
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive<br>
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br>
And I can&rsquo;t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse<br>

Damn</em><br>
-&ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give that throughout <em>DAMN.</em> Kendrick expressed a strong conviction that turning away from way of wickeness would require him to turn towards Jesus&rsquo;s way of weakess, it is ironic that throughout &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be condemning wickedness in others while simultanelous building himself up as someone who is strong enough to use violence against the wicked.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible</summary>
    
      <h4 id="this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">&ldquo;This shit done got too wicked to apologize&rdquo; &gt; Wicked sexual behavior in the Bible<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given that Drake is Jewish and Kendrick has identified himself as Christian on most of his albums and prays to God during the chorus of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, it seems appropriate to point out that the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament does have some very intense stories about humans (most often men) who perpetrate some remarkably intense, unjust, abusive and perverted sexual behavior. These stories and the consequences of the perverted sexual behavior can offer some perspective on whether Kendrick is being logically consistent with his assertion that the men at &ldquo;the party&rdquo; are &ldquo;too wicked to apologize.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in Genesis 19, two non-Israelite cities named Sodom and Gomorrah are home to men whar are so perverted that they try to gang rape new visitors to the city, including two men who are actually angels who have come to assess the city’s wickedness. At some point, one character who refuses to participate in the gang rapes nonetheless offers two of his own daughters to be gang raped instead to prevent the angels form getting gang raped. The perverted men never get a chance to rape anyone and the city soon gets destroyed by a fire and sulfur raining down from the skies to burn up the city in an event that is akin to a volcanic explosion or a meteor strike.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in Judges 19-21, the men in an Israelite city have become so perverted that they try to gang rape a fellow Israelite who is visiting the city. To avoid getting gang raped, the visitor leaves one of his wives outside the house where he is staying and locks the door behind her. The men of the city then proceed to gang rape her to death and leave her body lying in front of the door to the house where the visitor is staying. The gang rape of the visitor&rsquo;s wife leads to a civil war where thousand of men are killed. We war only resolves when the surviving men from the perverted city are allowed feast capture teenage girls from festal celebrationand force them into marriage.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a story recounted in 2 Samuel 11, David, the king of Israel, goes up to the roof of his palace one night, looks down at one of the neighboring houses and sees a beautiful woman naked while she is bathing. King David immediately is overwhelmed by a strong desire to have sex with her. King David learns that the woman&rsquo;s name is Bathsheba and that she is married to a man named Uriah who is one of his most loyal soldiers and is away at the battlefront with King David&rsquo;s army. Despite knowing that Bathsheba is married to Uriah and despite the fact that King David already has several wives, King David orders his servants to bring Bathsheba to his palace where he forces her to have sex with him. When King David finds out that Bathsheba has be pregnant he tries to hide the child. When he can’t successfully hide the child he orchestrates for her husband, Uriah, to be killed during a battle. King David is then free to marry Bathsheba and add her to his collection of wives.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae refernces this story of King David&rsquo;s sexual misconduct with Bathseba and murder of Uriah on &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo; when he raps:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>But when I take a look in the mirror<br>
The <strong>blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer</strong><br>
Who <strong>had Bathsheba in his quarters</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>God soon sends a prophet to confront King David and tell him that he has committed a great act of wickedness. David immediately repents and apologizes to God. He even writes a famous song called Psalm 51 in which King Devil acknowleges his acts of wickedness along with his need for repentance and forgiveness from God. Because of David’s repentance, God’s prophet told David that he would not die as a penalty for his wickedness<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, despite King David&rsquo;s repentance, the son that was born from King David&rsquo;s adulterous relationship got sick and died in infancy. Moreover later in David’s life, his oldest son exhibited similar tendencies of sexual misbehavior when this son raped one of his half-sisters. In response, King David&rsquo;s second son - who was the full brother of the daughter that was raped - exeuted a plot to murder the oldest son. King David&rsquo;s second son then rebelled against King David, started a civil war, made himself king, then went up on top of the palace roof where all the inhabitants of the city could see him and proceeded to raped all of King David’s lower status wives. The rebellious son did eventually lose the civil war and was killed, which allowed David to be restored as king but also led David into a state of depression.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the major lessons of King David&rsquo;s story is that even though God forgave King David, his wickedness still resulted in real world consequences for David, his family and the whole society around King David.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has clearly read the story of King David. Most notably, two days before the release of Kendrick&rsquo;s album <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick released the track &ldquo;The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?)&rdquo; where Kendrick revealed how the pressure of his rising status as the artistic reincarnation of 2Pac made him want to open the Bible, re-read the Book of David and reflect on how the lessons from that story could be applied to his own life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>With a Bible and rifle</strong>: I play the game as I &ldquo;blam-blaow!&rdquo;<br>
Holler back at me, nigga<br>
And if they said that I&rsquo;m the one, why you asking me, nigga?<br>
&lsquo;Cause when the whole world see you as &lsquo;Pac reincarnated<br>
<strong>Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David<br>
And pray to God that you make it</strong> or live your life in The Matrix<br>
&lsquo;Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it&rsquo;s quite contagious</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Kendrick knows the story of King David wicked behavior and subsequent aplology, it is ironic that Kendrick seems to be denying the possibility that people like Drake, Diddy or or any of the men who have participated in &ldquo;the party&rdquo; can ever truly apology or be forgiven by God or by society. From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that justifies his hatred against others who he himself judges to be beyond the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a Christian perspective, Kendrick seems to be selectively reading the Bible in a way that would him to justify the use of violence eliminate his enemies or those whom he considers to be an enemy of society, which is exactly what he does throughout the rest of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that the wickedness of the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; is on a totally different level than other negative behavior or even criminal offences that could be considered forgivable. From Kendrick&rsquo;s perspective, this different level of wickedness seems be justice getting these partygoers &ldquo;wacced&rdquo; and &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Wacced&rdquo; is slang for destroyed, defaced or disrespected.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of the word &ldquo;wacced&rdquo; would go on to become more notable a few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; when Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em> which opens with the track &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo;. On &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo;, Kendrick expresses anger after an unknown graffiti vandalizer &ldquo;wacced out&rdquo; a mural on the side of a Compton restaurant that a visual artist had created to honor Kendrick. The vandlism included Kendrick&rsquo;s face covered with the letter &ldquo;OVO&rdquo; in reference to Drake&rsquo;s OVO crew and record label which is a acronym for &ldquo;October&rsquo;s Very Own&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Yesterday, somebody wacced out my mural</strong><br>
That energy&rsquo;ll make you niggas move to Europe<br>
But it&rsquo;s regular for me, yeah, that&rsquo;s for sure<br>
The <strong>love and hate is definite</strong> without a cure</em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqflSI6KIoE">video</a> of the vandalizer spraying graffiti on Kendrick&rsquo;s mural was first posted to social media on September 8, 2024, just 3 days before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die.&rdquo; One could reasonably suppose that the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; on September 11 was partially a response to Kendrick&rsquo;s mural getting vandalized.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One can also reasonably argue that “wacced out murals” is essentially a simplified spiritual successor to “Watch the Party Die”. &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo; seems crafted to allow listeners to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the vitriol of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; without having to closely analyize the lyrics and discover the double entendres. This connection can be seen in the verses of “wacced out murals” where Kendrick threatens to “eliminate” anyone who is on “the other side” (i.e. not on God’s side). The third verse in particular also contains a direct reference to “Watch the Party Die” and to Katt Williams calling for the truth to be exposed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it&rsquo;s plural<br>
<strong>Fuck everybody</strong>, that&rsquo;s on my body<br>
<strong>My blick first</strong>, then God got me<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>This is not for lyricists</strong>, I swear it&rsquo;s not the sentiments<br>
<strong>Fuck a double entendre, I want y&rsquo;all to feel this shit</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Okay, nigga, let&rsquo;s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal<br>
Since y&rsquo;all pandering to <strong>choose a side</strong>, let me do it for you<br>
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, <strong>I watched the party just die</strong><br>
Niggas cackling about— while all of y&rsquo;all is on trial<br>
&hellip;<br>
Ayy, <strong>fuck anybody empathetic to the other side</strong>, I vow<br>
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with &rsquo;em in style<br>
<strong>Exterminate &rsquo;em right now</strong><br>
<strong>Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth &lsquo;bout to get loud</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I know propaganda work for them, and <strong>fuck whoever that&rsquo;s close to them</strong><br>
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein&rsquo; groomed, <strong>slide on both of them</strong></em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone is typically &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; from an activity or competition when they are exposed for lying, cheating or behaving in a way that is illegal or unethical. In the context of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick could be saying that rappers like Drake should be disqualified from the “rap game” or more specifically from the competition of being considered the greatest rapper.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, based on the violent language throughout “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick might also be claiming that the hosts and attendees of “the party” should be disqualified from the most basic activity of living life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kendrick seems to indicate that he and the peopole associated with him have already decided to kill anyone who is guilty of killing someone innocent.<br>
 </li>
<li>The first three lines of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; have expressed significant amounts of animosity and vitriol. However, this fourth line is the first instance where Kendrick explicitly advocates for death sentences and targeted executions as an act of vigilante justice where an individual or group without any legal authority decide to take the law into their own hands in order to punish offenders or address perceived injustices. Within the context of this track, Kendrick is establishing himself as the judge and jury while enlisting his supporters to join him as executioners.<br>
 </li>
<li>The idea of it being justified and even necessary to “kill the killers” brings up a longstanding political, sociological and philosophical debate about the best way to respond to potential wrongdoing, establish justice and maintain an orderly society. Within the large debate it should be noted that more than 50 countries including the United States of America currently  execute individuals who have been convincted of a crime that the justice system considers particularly egregious or distabilizing to social order.<br>
 </li>
<li>In America, crimes that are eligible for the death penalty tend to be ones that invole intentionally or unintentionally killing someone innocent whether through murder, terrorism, kidnapping, sexual assault, or drug trafficking. In contrast, European countries in the European Union have abolished the death penalty as punishment for crimes. However, historically most civilizations in human history have had some form of death penalty, often for crimes that did not involve killing anyone - including theft, adultery, sexual misbehavior, disrespecting a member of a higher class, and speaking against the state government or the state religion.<br>
 </li>
<li>While America and many other modern nations still justify the use of death sentences after a fair trial, all modern nation states - at least officially - oppose the use of individuals or groups taking the law into their own hands through vigilante justice. However, on an individual basis, many people do seem ready to accept, support and even celebrate a vigilante execution that is executed against someone whom they truly despise, even if that person has not broken any laws.</li>

<ul>
<li>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; this inclination for Americans to accept, support and even celebrate vigilante executions came to the surface after a 26-year old named Luigi Mangione gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare medical health insurance company. According to publish excerpts from Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s writings, he claims to have targed the UnitedHealthcare CEO due to his belief that UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies &ldquo;have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>Immediately after the shooting and even before his identity was uncovered, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/luigi-mangione-and-the-making-of-a-modern-antihero">Luigi Magnione became a kind of a folk hero</a> as countless people across social media platforms expressed agreement with the Mangione&rsquo;s assessment that &ldquo;these parasites simply had it coming&rdquo; and joined the shooter in expressing anger and vitriol against health insurance companies. This sentiment was widely expressed that Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsyvania were Mangione was arrested, gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G-cPdWNiE">press conference</a> where he said &ldquo;In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero hear me on this he is no hero.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>On an international, geopolitical scale, the idea of it being justified and even necessary to &ldquo;kill the killers&rdquo; has also been expressed in the context of war. In 2024, much of this justification has come from manypeople on both sides of the Israel vs. Hamas conflict that began on October 7, 2023, 11 months before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; after Hamas killed 1,195 Israelis, took 248 Israelis as hostages and - based on a few sources - sexually assaulted and gang raped numerous Israelis during the October 7 attack. Many people who supported the plight of the Palestinians justified the attack as a necessary response to how Israelis had previously killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Meanwhile, many supporter of Israel&rsquo;s War in Gaza justified killing the killers of innocent Israelies even tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed and two thirds of Gaza&rsquo;s buildings were damaged or destroyed.<br>
 </li>
<li>While &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; does not specifially address current events such at the War in Gaza and was released months before Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s vigilante execution, both of these current events reveal the cultural zeigtgeist in which which Kendrick wrote, recorded and released &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has explored the idea of killing the killers at length in his previous work most notably on the track “XXX.” from <em>DAMN</em>. On the first verse of &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) tells a story about a distressed friend who asked for advice on how to respond after gang members killed his son. Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) acknowledged that as a anointed (i.e. Christian) individual he theoretically knew better, but felt strongly that the friend should kill his sons killer.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101<br>
Said <strong>they killed his only son</strong> because of insufficient funds<br>
He was sobbin&rsquo;, he was mobbin&rsquo;, way belligerent and drunk<br>
Talkin&rsquo; out his head, philosophin&rsquo; on what the Lord had done<br>
<strong>He said, &ldquo;K-Dot, can you pray for me?</strong> It been a fucked up day for me<br>
<strong>I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome&rdquo;</strong><br>
He was lookin&rsquo; for some closure, hopin&rsquo; I could bring him closer<br>
To the spiritual, <strong>my spirit do know better, but I told him</strong><br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sugarcoat the answer for you, <strong>this is how I feel</strong><br>
<strong>If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin&rsquo; killed</strong><br>
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of<br>
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch<br>
I wait in front a nigga&rsquo;s spot and watch him hit his block<br>
I catch a nigga leavin&rsquo; service if that&rsquo;s all I got<br>
<strong>I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong><br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that&rdquo;<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward<br>
I can&rsquo;t even keep the peace, <strong>don&rsquo;t you fuck with one of ours<br>
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile the second verse of &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; explored how the inclination towards violence and killing the killers is a common pattern of thought within the American psyche in contrast to the mentality that was exemplified by Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hail Mary, <strong>Jesus</strong>, and Joseph<br>
The great <strong>American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives</strong><br>
<strong>Compulsive disorder</strong>, sons and daughters<br>
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us<br>
<strong>It&rsquo;s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
Homicidal thoughts</strong>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s in office<br>
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br>
But <strong>is America honest or do we bask in sin?</strong><br>
Pass the gin, <strong>I mix it with American blood<br>
Then bash him</strong> in, you Crippin&rsquo; or you married to Blood?<br>
I&rsquo;ll ask again, oops, accident<br>
It&rsquo;s nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up<br>
<strong>You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us</strong><br>
<strong>Gang members or terrorists</strong>, et cetera, et cetera<br>
<strong>America&rsquo;s reflections of me</strong>, that&rsquo;s what a mirror does</em>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that on “Worldwide Steppers” from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper</em> Kendrick asserted that we are all killers who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly cause the deaths of innocent people.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a killer, he&rsquo;s a killer, she&rsquo;s a killer</strong>, bitch<br>
<strong>We some killers</strong>, walkin&rsquo; zombies, tryna scratch that itch<br>
..<br>
<strong>Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers</strong><br>
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)<br>
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin&rsquo; philosophies<br>
You either gon&rsquo; be dead or in jail, <strong>killer psychology</strong><br>
Silent murderer, what&rsquo;s your body count? Who your sponsorship?<br>
Objectified so many bitches, <strong>I killed their confidence</strong> (What the—)<br>
The media&rsquo;s the new religion, <strong>you killed the consciousness</strong> (What the fuck?)<br>
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, <strong>you killed accomplishments</strong> (What the fuck?)<br>
<strong>Niggas killed freedom of speech</strong>, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)<br>
..<br>
<strong>I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community</strong><br>
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies<br>
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient<br>
But <strong>because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin&rsquo;</strong><br>
So what&rsquo;s the difference &rsquo;tween your life when hiding motives?<br>
More fatalities and reality bring you closure<br>
<strong>The noble person that goes to work and pray like they &lsquo;posed to?<br>
Slaughter people too, your murder&rsquo;s just a bit slower</strong></em><br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we apply the logic of &ldquo;Wordlwide Steppers&rdquo; to this current line on &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, the natural conclusion would suggest that beyond the powerful men who exploit, coerce and sexually abuse victims at parties, there is a much wider set of people whom Kendrick could justifiable kill through his vigilante executions.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, we should note that on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick first and foremost acknowledges that he himself is a killer in part due to his catering choices which might lead innocent children to long-term health complications and shortened lifespans. If we apply that logic from “Worldwide Steppers” to this line from “Watch the Party Die” it would seem that Kendrick is being a hypocrite for justifying his desire to kill the people who he despises while not acknowledging that he also deserves to be killed.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, on “Die for the Party” Lecrae looks at the man in the mirror, sees that he himself is a killer and a hyprocrite which leads him to acknowledge that he deserves death along with all the other hypocrites.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>killers</strong> sittin&rsquo; in they cell for <strong>takin&rsquo; somebody innocent</strong><br>
And they don&rsquo;t even feel no remorse, <strong>the worst ignorance</strong><br>
<strong>But when I take a look in the mirror</strong><br>
The <strong>blood of Uriah&rsquo;s on my hands &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m that killer</strong><br>
Who had Bathsheba in his quarters<br>
I&rsquo;m that- who let Eve taste the fruit of death, I&rsquo;m that sinner<br>
<strong>I deserve death along with all these liars and hypocrites</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>Burning the whole village with men, women and children would normally be seen as an act of injustice and inhumane brutality. However, if everyone is a killer, Kendrick seems to have no issue with any collateral damage that he would cause while trying to exterminate the wicked hosts and attendees of “the party”.<br>
 </li>
<li>The justification for burning the whole village naturlaly follows from the idea that we are all killers and the idea that we should kill the killers who like taking innocent lives.<br>
 </li>
<li>By saying “it’s really that time”, Kendrick connects the idea of burning the whole village to the opening line “I think it’s time to watch the party die”.</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament</summary>
    
      <h4 id="burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">&ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it&rsquo;s really that time&rdquo; &gt; Reqesting fire from heaven in the Old Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>From a biblical perspective, the idea of a whole village being burned does bring to mind the Old Testament story of Sodom and Gomorrah where two towns of rapists were destroyed by fire and sulfur raining down from the skies, as I mentioned in the <a href="#this-shit-done-got-too-wicked-to-apologize--wicked-sexual-behavior-in-the-bible">&ldquo;Wicked sexual misbehavior in the Bible&rdquo;</a> section.<br>
 </li>
<li>The motif of fire coming down from the sky gets further developed in the stories about the Prophet Elijah, who served as a prophet to the Northern Kingdom of Israel which had its capital in a city called Samaria.<br>
 </li>
<li>Around 50 years earlier The Northern Kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria had split from the Southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem after a rebellion and a near civil war.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>This split would be the begnning of a animosity between Samaria and Judah that would continue to escalate for centuries.<br>
 </li>
<li>In English, the name Judah which was later shortened to the word &ldquo;Jew&rdquo;, which is the word that is now used to refer to the ethnic group that is originally from this geographic area and the religion that was originally practided by this ethnic group.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the time, Israel had almost entirely turned away from worshiping God and were instead worship a fertility and sex god named Ba’al. As part of the worship of this fertility god, the Isrealites presumably would have been going to the god Ba’al’s temple to participate in feasts and have ritualized sex with temple prostitutes.<br>
 </li>
<li>The worship of Ba’al was introduced to the Kingdom of Israel by a king named Ahab who “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” King Ahab married a princess named Jezebel from one of the neighboring nations which God had specifically forbidden the Israelites from entering into marriage relationships because those nations worshiped false gods like the fertility god Ba’al.<br>
 </li>
<li>According to a prophesy from Elijah, God stopped the sky from raining any water to prove that worshiping the fertility and sex god Ba’al would actually diminish the land’s agricultural fertility and, as a consequence, also diminish the sexual fertility amongst the Israelites. This prophesy angered King Ahab and Queen Jezebel who then unsuccessfully tried to murder Elijah.<br>
 </li>
<li>At some point after Ahab’s son succeeded Ahab as king, God sent Elijah to confront the king about the ongoing worship of Ba’al. The king sent a military captain with fifty soldiers to kill Elijah. However, Elijah called down fire from the skies which came down and burned the captain and all the soldiers to death. he king then sent another captain with fifty of soldiers to kill Elijah but they too were burned to death when Elijah called down fire from the skies. Finally, a last captain of fifty soldiers came and humbled himself before Elijah, who this time did not call down fire on the soldiers. (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%201%3A1-15&amp;version=NASB">2 Kings 1:1-15</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Given the motif of fire raining down from the skies to destroy the wicked in the Old Teastament, it is notable that one particular New Testament story in St. Luke&rsquo;s account of the Gospel (aka &ldquo;Good News&rdquo;) seems to intentionally undermine the desire one might have for God to send fire to destroy one&rsquo;s enemies. (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209%3A52-56&amp;version=NASB">Luke 9:52-56</a>)<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that story, Jesus and his disciple go to a village in Samaria, the same city where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had long ago led the Israelites to worship the fertility and sex god, Ba’al.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the time of Jesus, the people of Samaria did worship Yahweh the God of Israel, but the Samaritans and the Judeans considered each other to be be enemies because:<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>The Judeans considered the Samaritans to be “heretics” who did not worship Yahweh in the way that Yahweh was supposed to be worshiped.<br>
 </li>
<li>About 550 years earlier, the Samaritans had tried to prevent the Judeans from building a temple in Jerusalem.<br>
 </li>
<li>About 140 years earlier, earlier there was a military campaign in which the Judeans from Jerusalem destroyed the Samaritan’s temple to Yahweh, killed lots of people and destroyed their capital city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Jesus entered the Sameritan village, Jesus&rsquo;s followers announced him as the rightful king of the Judeans who was on his way to Jerusalem to be crowned and enthroned as king. However, due the the longstanding hatred between Judeans and Samaritans, the Samaritans did not accept Jesus and expressed visible hostility to Jesus’s arrival.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two of Jesus’s disciples, St James and St. John, seemed to have been greatly displeased by the cold reception that the Samaritans were giving to Jesus. Likey influenced by their own hatred of the Samaritans, Jesus’s two disciples asked Jesus:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus immediately became angry with those two disciples and strongly criticized them by saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“You do not know what kind of spirit you belong to. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy human lives, but to [save / rescue / heal] them.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: The term “Son of Man” is how Jesus typically referred to himself in the Gospel accounts (See the Bible Project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6cWEcqxhlI">Son of Man video</a>).
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By expressinging his desire to “burn the whole village”, Kendrick seems to be exhibiting the same misguided way of thought as the disciples who wanted to destroy their enemies in the name of serving Jesus. In doing so, James, John and Kendrick totally disregarded Jesus’s desire to have his enemies apologize, repent and allow Jesus to save, rescue, and heal their lives.</p>

<li>Within the context of current events in 2024, one can also see the Israeli military action against Hamas and the resulting damage or destruction of two thirds of buildings in Gaza an example of the Israeli government deciding that it is justifable to “burn the whole village” in order to kill the killers who executed the October 7, 2023 attack.</li>

<li>Kendrick seems to claim that it is futile to use reason or rational arguments to convince the wicked party hosts and attendees to change their ways. These statements seem to provide further justification for his desire to kill anyone who has taken innocent lives.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “see the future first” could be a reference to Frank Ocean’s track, “Nikes”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>We&rsquo;ll let you guys prophesy</strong><br>
<strong>We gon&rsquo; see the future first</strong><br>
Living so the last night feels like a past life<br>
Speakin&rsquo; of the, don&rsquo;t know what got into people<br>
<strong>Devil be possessin homies</strong><br>
<strong>Demons try to body jump</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of “Nikes”, the people who “see the future first” seem to be the ones who truly have a prophetic vision. These true prophets stand in contrast to those who talk as if they can prophesy but are not actually able to see the future in advance.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has repeatedly identified himself as a prophet most prominently on the final track of <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> and on several tracks that were released in subsequent years.
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you&rsquo;re very welcome<br>
You tell me my song is more than a song, it&rsquo;s surely a blessing<br>
But <strong>a prophet ain&rsquo;t a prophet &rsquo;til they ask you this question</strong><br>
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?</em><br>
-&ldquo;Mortal Man&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>The reason my power&rsquo;s here on earth<br>
Salute the truth, when <strong>the prophet say</strong><br>
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA</em><br>
-&ldquo;DNA.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m not a trending topic, <strong>I&rsquo;m a prophet</strong><br>
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel</em><br>
-&ldquo;family ties&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick also seems to compare himself and the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry to the biblical prophet Elijah and the wicked Queen Jezebel who tried to imprison and kill all the true prophets of God who spoke truth while giving prominent positions to false prophets who told lies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s cynical to say I know these <strong>artists</strong> petrified<br>
The end result, in <strong>jail by Jezebel</strong> or <strong>drugged up full of lies</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, we could interpret the current line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to reason with rappers and members of the entertainment industry who profit from telling lies.</p>

<ul>
<li>The word “clown” is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who acts foolishly in a way that attracts a lot of attention.<br>
 </li>
<li>The word “circus” can also be used as a pejorative to describe an environment that is overcrowded, noisy and chaotic. This pejorative meaning of the word “circus” could potentially be used to description of the “party”, particularly since a party and a circus are both forms of communal entertainment.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, we could interpret this line as Kendrick saying that it is futile to argue with the rappers who and members of the entertainment industry who are working for the circus.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Walking someone down&rdquo; is a slang term which refers to premediated murder, particularly in a shooting where the shooter calmly executes his target.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In “euphoria” Kendrick confronts Drake while rapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever <strong>walked your enemy down</strong> like with a poker face?<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to inciting his supporters to kill the killers who like taking innocent lives. Kendrick justifies such murders by saying it will “do everyone a solid” which is a colloquial way of saying that killing such people will do everyone a favor.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to earlier line where Kendrick said <a href="#we-even-kill-the-killers-cause-they-like-taking-innocent-lives--current-events">“We even kill the killers &lsquo;cause they like taking innocent lives”</a>, it seems approximate to point out that a few months after the release of “Watch the Party Die” this logic was used by significant numbers of people to justify Luigi Mangione’s decision to kill the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. For example, in one <a href="https://youtu.be/KVsu-FHFds8?si=wNtKpbip_tFJOtl3">popular video</a> the host defends the shooters actions and fittingly refers to the shooter as &ldquo;Run &rsquo;em down Jake&rdquo; prior to the shooter&rsquo;s name being discovered and publicized.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tough love</summary>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The term &ldquo;tough love&rdquo; is stereotypically used by parents (particularly dads) to refer to painful discipline that is meant to benefit a child in the long run.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick specifically mentions “tough love” to describe the parenting Kendrick received from his father on the <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper</em> track “Father Time”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, &ldquo;<strong>Fuck a foul</strong>&rdquo;<br>
I&rsquo;m teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won&rsquo;t think out loud
&hellip;<br>
Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don&rsquo;t take those well<br>
Momma said, &ldquo;That boy is exhausted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<strong>Go fuck yourself<br>
If he give up now, that&rsquo;s gon&rsquo; cost him, life&rsquo;s a bitch</strong><br>
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,&rdquo; I got up quick<br>
I&rsquo;m chargin&rsquo; baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance<br>
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent<br>
Oh, this the part, <strong>he breaks my humility just for practice</strong><br>
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Early mornin&rsquo; wake-ups</strong> (Ah), <strong>practicin&rsquo; on day-offs</strong> (Ah)<br>
<strong>Tough love</strong> (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)<br>
&hellip;<br>
I got daddy issues, that&rsquo;s on me<br>
Lookin&rsquo; for, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, <strong>rarely empathizin&rsquo; for my relief</strong><br>
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee<br>
&lsquo;Cause if I cried about it, he&rsquo;d surely <strong>tell me not to be weak</strong><br>
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself<br>
<strong>Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that “Father Time” is one of the few tracks where Kendrick mentioned Drake by name prior to the feud.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Daddy issues kept me competitive</strong>, that&rsquo;s a fact, nigga<br>
I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what&rsquo;s the narrative, I am that nigga<br>
<strong>When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused</strong><br>
Guess I&rsquo;m not mature as I think, got some healin&rsquo; to do</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that on &ldquo;Father Time&rdquo; Kendrick higlighted how “tough love” can instill unhealthy patterns of thoughts and lead to immature competitiveness, it is ironic for inconisistent for Kendrick to justify the use of violence against his enemies by claiming it is a result of “tough love&quot;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also hinted at the idea of tough love leading to violence on “euphoria” when alluded to rapper YNW Melly. YNW Melly, whose legal last name is ironically &ldquo;Demons&rdquo;, released a hit single called &ldquo;Murder on My Mind” in June 2018 just a few months before a shooting in which he was later accused of murdering two of his close friends, rappers YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>three GOATs left</strong>, and I seen <strong>two of them kissin&rsquo; and huggin&rsquo; on stage</strong><br>
I love &rsquo;em to death and in eight bars, I&rsquo;ll explain that phrase, huh<br>
&hellip;<br>
I pray they my real friends, if not, <strong>I&rsquo;m YNW Melly</strong> .</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick now seems to be targeting rappers, social media influencers and other members the entertainment industry who glorify greed, instant gratification and conspicuous, unhealthy consumption, particularly when such individuals never actually offer truth to innocent youth whose lives may be shortened if they immitate the examples that are given to them by the entertainment indudstry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has discussed the theme of unhealthy consumption throughout his career.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The track “Vanity Slaves” from the <em>Kendrick Lamar EP</em> explores the ways in which Black people in America have become enslaved to White-owned businesses and corporations who lead Black people into financial mismanagement and ruin. From this perspective, Kendrick could make a compelling case that parading gluttony leads to generational racial injustice that dehumanizes Black people much like slavery.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I care about my pride too much</strong><br>
<strong>If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush</strong><br>
If my hair is cut, <strong>if my diamonds is crushed</strong><br>
I look in the mirror, I&rsquo;m trendy enough? Wrong<br>
<strong>Insecurity roams the black community<br>
Homes where kids must have jewelry</strong><br>
The high school female need earrings and details<br>
<strong>So she can be cool</strong> to be amongst popularity<br>
The various <strong>name brands</strong> that reached the price scan<br>
It&rsquo;s not about the right price but more like the right scam<br>
<strong>To rule us all, confuse us all</strong><br>
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw<br>
Now let&rsquo;s draw<br>
The picture of <strong>a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for</strong><br>
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house<br>
That lives around his neck like a white collar<br>
So why fast forward? Then I&rsquo;ll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to <strong>slavery times</strong><br>
Pickin&rsquo; cotton from a field that a white man own<br>
The blacker you are farther you from the white man&rsquo;s home<br>
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity<br>
Before your vanity, they parted our families<br>
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed<br>
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules<br>
And <strong>trapped our minds in a cage</strong>, our freedom was so vague<br>
&hellip;<br>
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot<br>
Called us niggers and figured that we&rsquo;d never live in <strong>pursuit<br>
Of happiness</strong>, we capture these feelings in things that we do<br>
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to<br>
About a perspective, <strong>my shoe selection gotta be Louie<br>
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci</strong>, it&rsquo;s fake then she fool me<br>
She still bad though and her fake Gucci ain&rsquo;t that bad though<br>
We fillin&rsquo; up the gas for <strong>Rollies</strong><br>
Upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin&rsquo; <strong>Kobes</strong><br>
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya<br>
He overcompensate for the life of his ancestors<br>
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw<br>
The reason why the next four-hundred <strong>we gotta floss<br>
Slaves</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I said the four-hundred years we never had nothin&rsquo;<br>
Barely had clothes on our back<br>
Is the reason why <strong>when we get a little bit of change<br>
We over exaggerate on our livin&rsquo; expenses</strong><br>
So <strong>if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house</strong><br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
If you&rsquo;re a female and you <strong>got four, five, six rings on your finger</strong><br>
<strong>Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin&rsquo;</strong><br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
<strong>If you got an &lsquo;02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it<br>
And on the back of the window it says, &ldquo;Get on my level, ho&rdquo;<br>
You&rsquo;re a vanity slave<br>
We all vanity slaves</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track “Alright” followed by “For Sale? (Interlude)” on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, parading gluttony to tempt young Black people is a satanic plot that is utilized by Lucy (aka Lucifer / the satan / the devil / the false accuser / the adversary / the diabolical one).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?<br>
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?<br>
Anything, see my name is Lucy</strong>, I&rsquo;m your dog<br>
Motherfucker, <strong>you can live at the mall</strong><br>
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it&rsquo;s illegal<br>
I don&rsquo;t think about it, I deposit every other zero<br>
Thinkin&rsquo; of my partner, <strong>put the candy paintin&rsquo; on the Regal</strong><br>
Diggin&rsquo; in my pocket, ain&rsquo;t a profit big enough to feed you<br>
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you<br>

-&ldquo;Alright&rdquo;
 <br>
<em><strong>My name is Lucy, Kendrick</strong>, you introduced me, Kendrick<br>
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick<br>
<strong>Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories<br>
About these rappers that I came after</strong> when they was boring<br>
<strong>Lucy gon&rsquo; fill your pockets<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; move your mama out of Compton<br>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br>
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty</strong>, avoiding me?<br>
It&rsquo;s not so easy, I&rsquo;m at these functions accordingly</em><br>
-&ldquo;For Sale (Interlude)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “LUST.” Kendrick raps from the perspective of a man and a woman who is being controlled by demonic forces and driven towards an endless routine of conspicuous, unhealthy consumption. Within the logic of “LUST” demonic forces seem to be at work under the surface in ways that we normally don’t notice and thus don’t realize how Black people are being enslaved in a way that is arguably too wicked to apologize.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Wake up in the mornin&rsquo;, thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout money</strong>, kick your feet up<br>
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then <strong>roll some weed up</strong><br>
<strong>Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don&rsquo;t go to work today<br>
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks</strong> and make it work today<br>
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama<br>
<strong>Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window</strong><br>
Bet your favorite team, <strong>play you some Madden<br>
Go to the club</strong> or your mama house<br>
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
 <br>
Wake up in the morning, thinking &lsquo;bout money, kick your feet up<br>
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up<br>
<strong>Touch on yourself</strong>, call up your nigga, tell him he ain&rsquo;t shit<br>
Credit card scam, <strong>get you a Visa</strong>, make it pay your rent<br>
<strong>Hop on the &lsquo;Gram, flex on the bitches</strong> that be hatin&rsquo; on you<br>
<strong>Pop you a pill</strong>, call up your bitches, have &rsquo;em waitin&rsquo; on you<br>
<strong>Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s whatever, just make it count</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of “LUST.”, Kendrick references a New Testament Bible passage that speakes directly to the dangers of being controlled by gluttony and lust.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lately, in <strong>James 4:4</strong> says<br>
&ldquo;<strong>Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord</strong>&rdquo;<br>
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>James 4:4 refers to a section of teaching that St. James, the step brother of Jesus, gave to Christians who were getting into conflicts because of their lust, gluttony and desire for all material possession that can be obtained in this world. St. James warns these Christians that living in this way leads to pride (i.e. exalting themselves above other to get what they want). Morover, St. James warns that those who become proud become enemies of God, who opposes those who are proud and gives grace to those who are humble.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Where do wars and fighting among you come from? Don’t they come from your desires that war in your body parts? You lust, and do not have. You murder and want what someone else has, and can’t obtain it. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your desires</strong>.
 <br>
You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that <strong>friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</strong> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “<strong>God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble</strong>.
 <br>
Therefore submit yourself to God. <strong>Resist the devil</strong>, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you inconsistent people. Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. <strong>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>

 </li>
<li>Since their deaths are all but certain, Kendrick cold-heartedly recommends that these people should make plans for their own funeral. Since these people have been so consumed by their own vanity for commercialized products, Kendrick seems to suggest that they should take the time to pick the casket that will allow them to take their vanity to the grave.</li>

<li>Here Kendrick seems to criticizing social media influencers who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;. These influencers are often followed by thousands or even millions of impressionable young people. Once they amass a significant number of followers, these particular influencers profit from convincing young people that they need to buy sponsored products which may then lead young people to steal money through credit card scams.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is worth noting that in the years prior to the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; several social science research studies published papers which found <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.870614/full">connections between materialistic social media content and problematic consumption behavior among young people</a>.<br>

<li>
<p>For Kendrick &ldquo;basic shit&rdquo; from the mainstream entertainment industry seems to be the exact opposite of the thoughful, complex and creative aristry that has defined Kendrick&rsquo;s career, most notably with Kendrick&rsquo;s album, DAMN. winning a <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kendrick-lamar">Pulitzer Prize</a>.<br>
 </p>

<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Poetic Justice&rdquo; (ft. Drake) from <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick highlights how finding someone who is not &ldquo;basic&rdquo; is as rare as finding a flower that bloomed in a dark room.</p>

<p>While the term “dickriding” is most often used metaphorically to describe someone who says an excessive amount of good things to gain favor, the most literal usage of the term refers to a man or woman who willingly receives anal or vaginal sexual penetration from a powerful man in order to receive favorable treatment or economic opportunities.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8oRRZiRQxTs?si=Tag2nxKG36JIAT1H&amp;t=6033">viral Club Shay Shay interview (1:40:33 - 1:44:00)</a> Katt Williams highlighted how from the start of his career in the entertainment industry his entire goal was to become successful without ever literally or metaphorically riding anyone’s dick.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My goal was to get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never had sucked a penis</strong>. That was my only goal.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;ve had to turn down $50 million four times</strong> - four times - just <strong>to protect my integrity and that virgin hole</strong> I was telling you about, right. Cause <strong>P Diddy be wanting to party and you got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong> You&rsquo;ve got to tell him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I did.</em></li>

<li>
<p>In contrast to men who &ldquo;dickride&rdquo; and are &ldquo;with the basic shit&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be highlighting the kinds of rare character traits and behaviors that he wants his people to nurture, particularly self improvement, education, hard work, financial stability and a desire or thirst for things that will lead to life.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are traits and behaviors that often best developed during childhood and adolescence and thus would be at risk if rappers, infuencers or members of the entertainment industry are allowed to “parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More specifically, Kendrick is looking for the rare men who have the mentality of soldiers who lost everything in battle but found a way to learn invaluable life lessons from those losses.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick could be looking to recruit these soldiers to be his executioners.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts” from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick mentioned that the ability to learn from a loss is something that he did not receive from how his own father parented him but it is a blessing that Kendrick want his loved ones to receive</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Daddy issues made me lеarn losses</strong>, I don&rsquo;t take those well</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Thirst is a concept that Kendrick mentioned on the latter half of the pivotal track “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” from good kid, m.A.A.d city. On that track, Kendrick described how a life of gluttony led to them to be overcome by a deep spiritual thirst.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>How many sins</strong>, oh? I&rsquo;m runnin&rsquo; out, oh<br>
How many sins, oh? I lost count<br>
Dreams of ballin&rsquo; like Spalding<br>
But only shotty bounce, oh<br>

<strong>You dyin&rsquo; of thirst, you dyin&rsquo; of thirst<br>
So hop in that water, and pray that it works</strong></em>.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the track “LUST.” from <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick seems to allude to the experience of &ldquo;daying of thirst&rdquo; as he reveals the demonic influence that driving people towards greed, conspicuous consumption, and need for &ldquo;holy water&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I need some water</strong><br>
Something came over me<br>
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a skit at the end of &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst&rdquo;, an older Christian woman sees that Kendrick and his friends were &ldquo;dying of thirst&rdquo; because their sadness and anger was driving them towards killing their enemies and putting their own lives at risk. She tells them that their thirst for blood and violence was really a spiritual thirst could only be satisfied by “holy water”, being baptized by the Spirit of the Lord, and receiving a new kind of life from Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?<br>
I know that&rsquo;s not what I think that is<br>
Why are you so angry?<br>
See, <strong>you young men are dying of thirst</strong><br>
Do you know what that means?<br>
<strong>That means you need water, holy water<br>
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord<br>
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?</strong><br>
Okay, repeat after me:<br>
&ldquo;Lord God, I come to You a sinner&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And I humbly repent for my sins&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe that Jesus is Lord&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe You raised Him from the dead&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I would ask that Jesus come into my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And be my Lord and Savior&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I receive Jesus to take control of my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>And that I may live for Him from this day forward</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus<br>
For saving me with Your precious blood&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name, amen&rdquo;<br>
Alright now, remember this day<br>
<strong>The start of a new life, your REAL life</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The older Christian woman&rsquo;s conclusion that Kendrick and his homies are dying of thirst and need holy water seems to come from scene in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel. In that scene, Jesus stopped to rest in a village inhabitted by people from ethnic group called Samaritans, who were enemies of the the Judean ethnic group to which Jesus belonged. Instead of calling down fire from heaven to burn up the Samaritan village, Jesus started a conversation with a Samaritan woman who was drawing water from a well. Jesus told the woman that he could give her &ldquo;living water&rdquo; which would satisfy her to the extent that she would never thirst again.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.<br>
 <br>
So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Judean, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Judeans do not associate with Samaritans).<br>
 <br>
Jesus replied to her, “<strong>If you knew the gift of God</strong>, and who it is who is saying to you, &lsquo;Give Me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and <strong>He would have given you living water</strong>.”<br>
 <br>
She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” Jesus answered and said to her, “<strong>Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.</strong>”</em><br>
 <br>
-John 4:5,7-14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, as Jesus repeated his offer of &ldquo;living water&rdquo; to a crowd of people at a holiday feast, St. John explained that the &ldquo;living water&rdquo; which Jesus spoke about was actually the &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo;. Jesus would give the &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; to his disciples so that his disciples would be filled with new patterns of thoughts and emotions that would empower them to live a new kind of life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “<strong>If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink</strong>. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, &lsquo;From his innermost being will <strong>flow rivers of living water</strong>.&rsquo;”<br>
 <br>
This He said in <strong>reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive.</strong></em><br>
 <br>
-John 7:37-39<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus told the sister of Jesus&rsquo;s dead friend that “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&amp;version=NASB">John 11:1-45</a>).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth and the life” (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&amp;version=NASB">John 14:2-6</a>)
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When applied to this line on “Watch the Party Die”, the belief that Jesus is &ldquo;the life&rdquo; and the giver of &ldquo;living water&rdquo; implies that a “thirst for life” is truly a “thirst for Jesus”. Moreover, those who &ldquo;thirst for life&rdquo; discover that Jesus will satisfy their deepest thirst when they read the stories about Jesus in the &ldquo;Good Book&rdquo;, aka the Holy Bible.</p>

<li>Kendrick seems to highlight the virtue of individuals who know that they will earn a reward when they do the right thing, which motivates them to read books and get information that will allow them to find out what is right.

<li>Kendrick seems to be asserting that the vast majority of men currently have not developed the kind of virtuous traits that behaviors that Kendrick described in the previous lines.

<ul>
<li>In contrast to rappers who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;, Kendrick expresses his sadness at the loss of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved South Central rapper who was murdered in March of 2019. Nipsey&rsquo;s murder was particularly tragic because Nispey had shown a remarkable commitment, vision, ingenuity, entreprenership, business accumen and diplomacy in his efforts to improve his local community.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nipsey started a community co-working space named <a href="https://www.thesportspublicist.com/agency/vector-90-x-nispey-hussle">Vector 90</a> which provided opportunities for Black youth in Crenshaw to take science, technology, engineering and math courses and develop as entrepreneurs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nipsey was closely involved in the planning and advisory stages of an open air museum called Destination Crenshaw which planned to showcase the history and culture of Black people in his neighborhood.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nipsey arranged meetings between the Los Angeles Police Department to discuss ways to stop gang violence.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Nipsey&rsquo;s death, former president Barack Obama wrote a tribute which said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it – to build a skills training center and a coworking space in Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean-American community; to set an example for young people to follow – is a legacy worthy of celebration. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it.</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the verses of “Watch the Party Die”, which seem to be persuasive rhetoric addressed to those who will support Kendrick&rsquo;s campaign of vigilante executions, the chorus seems to be a prayer that is addressed to God.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of praying to God is a recurring motif in Kendrick&rsquo;s work going all the way back to the track &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; on Kendrick&rsquo;s first project under the name Kendrick Lamar, the 2009 <em>Kendrick Lamar EP</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I found myself losing focus <strong>at a Sunday service</strong><br>
Embarrassed so <strong>I start questioning God, &ldquo;What is my purpose?&rdquo;</strong><br>
<strong>He said to live the way he did</strong>, that&rsquo;s all he want from me<br>
<strong>Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday</strong><br>
I said alright, <strong>enthused that my Lord gave a listen</strong><br>
<strong>I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian</strong><br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2012, Kendrick used his major label debut album, <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> to tell the backstory of how he first became a Christian. The album&rsquo;s first track, &ldquo;Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;, begins with Kendrick and his homies saying a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinner%27s_prayer">&ldquo;Sinners Prayer&rdquo;</a> to receive Jesus as there &ldquo;personal savior&rdquo;. This prayer is later heard within the narrative context during the pivotal moment in &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst&rdquo; when an older Christian woman approachs Kendrick and his homies and implores them to start a new way of life after Kendrick&rsquo;s friend Dave died in a gang shootout.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?<br>
I know that&rsquo;s not what I think that is<br>
Why are you so angry?<br>
See, you young men are dying of thirst<br>
Do you know what that means?<br>
That means you need water, holy water<br>
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord<br>
<strong>Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?</strong><br>
Okay, <strong>repeat after me</strong>:<br>
<strong>&ldquo;Lord God, I come to You a sinner&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And I humbly repent for my sins&rdquo;</strong><br>
&ldquo;I believe that Jesus is Lord&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I believe You raised Him from the dead&rdquo;<br>
<strong>&ldquo;I would ask that Jesus come into my life&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And be my Lord and Savior&rdquo;</strong><br>
&ldquo;I receive Jesus to take control of my life&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And that I may live for Him from this day forward&rdquo;</em>*<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood&rdquo;<br>

<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s second major label album, <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of Lucy (aka Lucifer / the devil / the satan / the false accuser / the diabolical one). Lucy acknowledges that Lucy heard Kendrick saying the &ldquo;Sinner&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; to God the Father on <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, but was nonetheless confident that Kendrick would abandon God and pursue Lucy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You said <strong>Sherane ain&rsquo;t got nothing on Lucy</strong><br>

<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s third major label album, <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick (or Kung Fu Kenny) repeatedly expressed feelings of sadness and frustration because he felt that nobody was praying for him. Then during the album&rsquo;s pibotal track, &ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;, Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail explaining that Kendrick&rsquo;s feelings of sadness and frustration were not due to a lack of people praying for him but were instead do to Kendrick&rsquo;s own lack of faithfulness in following the Lord&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>

<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s fourth major label album, <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick seemed to depict himself as being—at least temporarily—distant from God and detached from his identity as a Christian while exploring alternative spiritual practices including praying to flowers and trees.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, <strong>I prayed to the flowers and trees</strong><br>

<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s first battle track, &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo;, Kendrick implied that Drake was an absentee father while rapping about the role as a father, including responsibility of teaching one&rsquo;s son to pray.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y&rsquo;all think all my life is rap?<br>
That&rsquo;s ho shit, <strong>I got a son to raise</strong>, but I can see you don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that<br>
Wakin&rsquo; him up, know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that<br>
<strong>Then tell him to pray</strong>, know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that<br>
Then givin&rsquo; him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that<br>
Teachin&rsquo; him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that<br>
<strong>Speakin&rsquo; the truth and consider what God&rsquo;s considerin&rsquo;</strong>, you don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Kendrick&rsquo;s second battle record, &ldquo;6:16 in LA&rdquo;, Kendrick spoke directly to God while seemingly confessing that he was engaging in the battle with Drake in part because his identity is wrapped up in being a solider who needs to go to war in order to have a stable identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom<br>
<strong>God</strong>, ah, my confession is yours<br>
But, <strong>who am I if I don&rsquo;t go to war?</strong></em></li>
</ul>

      <h4 id="god-give-me-life-dear-god-please-give-me-peace--the-lords-prayer">&ldquo;God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace&rdquo; &gt; The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#god-give-me-life-dear-god-please-give-me-peace--the-lords-prayer">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea of a perosn praying for God to give them what they truly need is one of the central points of the most famous and univeral Christian prayer, which is known as the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo;. Thos who pray the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer asks for God the Father to give them their &ldquo;daily bread&rdquo; in referrence to the essential physical and spiritual need on a daily basis in order to live.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Our Father</strong>, who is in heaven,<br>
hallowed be Your name.<br>
Your Kingdom come.<br>
Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
<strong>Give us today our daily bread</strong>,<br>
and forgive us our tresspasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us,<br>
and lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from the evil one.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;bread&rdquo; being symbolic for the things that someone needs to live is further explored in a story where Jesus multiplies five loves of bread in order to feed five thousand men and their families (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A13-21&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 14:13-21</a> or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A1-15&amp;version=NASB">John 6:1-15</a>).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, after a crowd of those who ate the multiplied bread started to focus exclusively on their desire for Jesus to fulfill their physical hunger for physical bread, Jesus told the crowd that he himself is the spiritual &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; and that anyone who eats Jesus as the &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; will live forever.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus said to them, “<strong>I am the bread of life</strong>; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. For <strong>this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life</strong>, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day. <strong>I am the bread of life</strong>. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that <strong>anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh</strong>. Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life</strong>, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, <strong>the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.</strong></em><br>
-Matthew 6:35,40,48-58</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, just before Jesus was arrrested and executed on a cross, he shared a meal of bread and wine his disciples and told them that the bread was his body and the wine was his blood. This particular meal of Jesus&rsquo;s disciplles eating bread as Jesus&rsquo;s body and drinking wine as Jesus&rsquo;s blood became a the most central Christian spiritual practice known as the &ldquo;communion&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Eucharist&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Jesus took some bread</strong>, and after a blessing, He broke it and <strong>gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.”</strong> nd when He had taken <strong>a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the [covenant / agreement]</strong>, which is being poured out <strong>for many for forgiveness of sins</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, if we see Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer during the chorus of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; as an echo of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, we could conclude that what Kendrick truly needs to receive is Jesus himself and the new way of life that comes from living in close communion with Jesus. This is the same conclusion that was presented to Kendrick when the older Christian woman convinced Kendrick and his homies not to kill their enemies and instead led them to say the &ldquo;Sinner&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;Sing About Me, I&rsquo;m Dying of Thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&rdquo;<strong>I would ask that Jesus come into my life</strong>&quot;<br>
&ldquo;And <strong>be my Lord</strong> and Savior&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<strong>I receive Jesus to take control of my life</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And <strong>that I may live for Him</strong> from this day forward&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Jesus for <strong>saving me with Your precious blood</strong>&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name, amen&rdquo;<br>
Alright now, remember this day<br>
<strong>The start of a new life, your REAL life</strong></em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to referring to himself as the &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo;, Jesus also describes himself as &ldquo;the life&rdquo; on a few other occasions in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel.</p>
<ul>
<li>After one of Jesus&rsquo;s friends died, Jesus told the sister of the friend, “I am the resurrection and the life”. Jesus then went on to resurrect his friend from death to life (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-45&amp;version=NASB">John 11:1-45</a>).<br>
 </li>
<li>In that same Gospel account, Jesus also told his disciples, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth and the life” (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2-6&amp;version=NASB">John 14:2-6</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus repeatedly teaches that he came to earth not to kill or destroy humans but to give &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; to all those who would listen to his teaching and believed in him.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Son of Man be lifted up, so that <strong>everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him</strong>. For <strong>God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life</strong>. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.</em><br>
-John 3:14-17<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life</strong>; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life.</em><br>
-John 3:36<br>
 <br>
<em>Jesus answered and said to the Samaritan woman, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but <strong>the water that I will give him will become</strong> in him <strong>a fountain of water springing up to eternal life</strong>.”</em><br>
-John 4:13-14<br>
 <br>
The one who reaps is receiving wages and is <strong>gathering fruit for eternal life</strong>.*<br>
-John 4:36<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life</strong>, and does not come into judgment, but has <strong>passed out of death into life</strong>.</em><br>
-John 5:24<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life</strong>; and <strong>it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me</strong>; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.</em><br>
-John 5:39-40<br>
 <br>
*Do not work for the food that perishes, but *<em>work for the <strong>food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you</strong>.</em><br>
-John 6:27<br>
 <br>
<em>For <strong>this is the will of My Father</strong>, that <strong>everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life</strong>, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.</em><br>
-John 6:40<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.</strong> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that <strong>anyone may eat from it and not die</strong>. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; <strong>if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever</strong>; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.</em><br>
-John 6:47-51<br>
 <br>
<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. <strong>The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life</strong>, and I will raise him up on the last day.</em><br>
-John 6:53-54<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish</strong>; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.</em><br>
-John 10:27-28<br>
 <br>
<em>The one who loves his life loses it, and <strong>the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life</strong>.</em><br>
-John 12:25<br>
 <br>
<em>The Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. And <strong>I know that His commandment is eternal life</strong></em>.<br>
-John 12:49-50</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of these teachings about &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; lead up to a culminating prayer in which Jesus talks directly to God the Father and declares that &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; is the experience of knowing God the Father and Jesus as the Son of God in a close relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Jesus spoke</strong> these things; and <strong>raising His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father</strong>, the hour has come; glorify <strong>Your Son</strong>, so that the Son may glorify You, just as You gave Him authority over all humanity, so that to all whom You have given Him, He <strong>may give eternal life. this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ</strong> whom You have sent.</em><br>
-John 17:1-3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, when Kendrick prays &ldquo;God, give me life&rdquo;, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is life. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about love and forgivness so that Kendrick can judge and execute the very same people who Jesus came to offer eternal life.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Just before he was arrested and executed, Jesus gave one final teaching to his disciples. In that final teaching, Jesus said that he was giving &ldquo;peace&rdquo; to his disciples. Moreover, Jesus clarified that that he himself is the peace that he was giving to his disciples. The disciples would receive this peace by listening to Jesus&rsquo; words and remaining in close relationship with Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you</strong>; not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. These things I have spoken to you so that <strong>in Me you may have peace</strong>. In the world you have oppression, but be of good courage for I have overcome the world.</em><br>
-John 14:27, 16:33</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, in Jesus&rsquo;s most famous collection of teachings, he declared that his disciples will be blessed with a close relationship to God the Father when they serve as peacemakers in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessed are the peacemakers</strong>, for they <strong>will be called children of God</strong>.
-Matthew 5:9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, when Kendrick prays &ldquo;dear God, please give me peace&rdquo;, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is peace. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about being a peacemaker so that Kendrick can try to overcome the evils of the world through violence.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, the word &ldquo;lame&rdquo; refers to anything that is not cool, refined or worthy of honor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer to keep &ldquo;these lame niggas away&rdquo; seems to echo the end of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer which asks God the Father to lead his people away from tempting situations and away from the &ldquo;evil one&rdquo; in reference to the [devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one].</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Lead us not into temptation</strong>, but <strong>deliver us from the evil one.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By praying to &ldquo;keep these lame niggas away from me&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be asserting that these &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; members of &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; which is opposed to &ldquo;God&rsquo;s side&rdquo;. If Kendrick was to follow the example of Jesus and the early praying to transform these &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; so that they could repent, apologize and come to &ldquo;God&rsquo;s side&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In hip hop terminology, “shining” refers to wearing gaudy amounts of expensive, shiny diamond jewelry or otherwise making public displays of one&rsquo;s success, wealth and power.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Kendrick earlier expressed his desire to kill rappers, influencers, and members of the entertainment industry who “parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth”, it is likely that Kendrick is not asking God to give him shiny jewelry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the previous requests for life and peace, it seems more likely that Kendrick is making a request for spiritual well-being rather than material or financial well-being.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical terminology “shining” refers to the way in which people who follow God&rsquo;s commandments serve as bright example of how other humans should live.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the introduction to St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, St. John introduces Jesus by saying that Jesus is the &ldquo;true light&rdquo; who has existed even before the universe was created. Moreover, St. John asserts through Jesus&rsquo;s birth as a human, the &ldquo;light&rdquo; has now come down from the skies to &ldquo;shine&rdquo; on humans and penetrate through the darkness of human wickedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and <strong>the life was the light of humanity. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn&rsquo;t overcome it…the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. John&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a crowd of listeners that he is the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; that humans can follow so that they find the light of life and no longer walk towards the darkness of death.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “<strong>I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life</strong>.”</em><br>
-John 8:12</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to identifying himself as the &ldquo;light of the word&rdquo;, in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus also taught his disciples that they are the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; who are meant to &ldquo;shine&rdquo; the light of Jesus&rsquo;s way of life so that people in the world no longer have to walk towards the darkness of death.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You all are the light of the world</strong>. A city located on a hill can&rsquo;t be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bucket, but on a lampstand; so it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, <strong>let your light shine before humans, so that they may see your good actions and glorify your Father who is in heaven</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 6:14-16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By teaching that humans who are faithful to God will shine spiritual light to indicate how other humans should live, Jesus seems to be referring to a Old Testament prophesy from the Prophet Daniel.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Many of those who sleep (i.e. are dead) in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt. <strong>Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the sky. Those who turn many toward right relationship will shine as the stars forever and ever.</strong></em><br>
-Daniel 12:2-3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by praying &ldquo;Dear God, keep me shinin&rsquo;&rdquo;, Kendrick is really praying for God to give him a close relationship with Jesus, who is light. This request is ironic because throughout the verses Kendrick seems to be ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s teachings about being a &ldquo;light to the world&rdquo; by being an example to those who are living in darkness and giving them an opportunity to turn towards right relationships with other humans. Rather than turning wicked people toward the light of life, Kendrick keeps expressing his desire to bring the darkness of death upon the hosts and attendees of the party.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s prayer to God seems to be interrupted as he wonders what the “lame niggas&quot; who thinking about Kendrick. Kendrick seems to conclude that that the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; are thinking that Kendrick is acting like a police officer who is &ldquo;pocket-watching&rdquo; them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Pocket-watching&rdquo; refers to the act of closely monitoring what another person is doing—particularly regarding their use of money—so that monitoring person can make some kind of judgement or assessment of the other person.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within hip hop culture, rappers, hustlers and &ldquo;steet niggas&rdquo; often describe an adversarial relationship with the police, most famously on the legendary rap group NWA&rsquo;s hit single &ldquo;Fuck tha Police.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying that Kendrick &ldquo;must be the police&rdquo;, the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; seem to be expressing some amount of nervousness that they might be caught, prosecuted, and judged for any illicit actions that they might have committed at &ldquo;the party&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that Kendrick “must be the police” would also align with the battle track “meet the grahams”, where Kendrick claimed to be &ldquo;policing&rdquo; the &ldquo;weird shit&rdquo; going on in the entertainment industry after he dropped the bombshell allegation that Drake and his OVO crew have allegedly been sex trafficking under aged girls.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra, sit down, what I&rsquo;m about to say is heavy, now listen<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After wondering what the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo; were thinking about him, Kendrick goes back to praying to God. He now asks for God to &ldquo;bless&rdquo; the words that he is rapping and the words that he is thinking.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In biblical terminology a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; refers to God giving preferential favor to a people, places, objects or things so that they may bring about more life and goodness on the earth.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the very first narrative of the Bible, God gave a blessing to animals and then humans so that they would reproduce new life that fill the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>God created</strong> the great sea creatures and <strong>every living creature</strong> that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. <strong>God blessed them</strong>, saying, “<strong>Be fruitful and multiply</strong>, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”<br>
 <br>
<strong>God created humanity</strong> in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. <strong>God blessed them</strong>; and God said to them, “<strong>Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth</strong>, and subdue it; and <strong>rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth</strong>.”</em>
-Genesis 1:21-23,27-28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when humans are tempted by a devil in the form of a snake and disobey God&rsquo;s commandment by trying to define good and evil for themselves, their actions result in curse which leads to death and evil on the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Then the LORD <strong>God said to the snake</strong>,<br>
 <br>
“Because you have done this,<br>
<strong>Cursed are you</strong> more than all the livestock,<br>
And more than any animal of the field;<br>
On your belly you shall go,<br>
And <strong>you shall eat dust<br>
All the days of your life</strong>;<br>
 <br>
Then the LORD <strong>God said to the human</strong>, “<strong>Because you</strong> have listened to the voice of your wife, and <strong>have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, &lsquo;You shall not eat from it&rsquo;</strong>:<br>
 <br>
<strong>Cursed is the ground because of you</strong>;<br>
With hard labor you shall eat from it<br>
All the days of your life.<br>
<strong>It will grow both thorns and thistles</strong> for you;<br>
Yet you shall eat the plants of the field;<br>
By the sweat of your face<br>
You shall eat bread,<br>
<strong>Until you return to the ground</strong>,<br>
Because from it you were taken;<br>
For you are dust,<br>
And <strong>to dust you shall return</strong>.”</em>
-Genesis 3:14,17-19</li>

<li>
<p>The story of humanity receiving a blessing or a curse depending on whether they obey or disobey God&rsquo;s commandments is a recurring biblical motif that gets further developed in the Book of Deuteronomy when the Prophet Moses gives a speech to the Israelites before they go into the &ldquo;Promised Land&rdquo; which God had prepared for them. Moses repeatedly told the Israelites that God was offering them a choice between life and death, between a blessing and a curse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you diligently obey the Lord your God</strong>, being careful to <strong>do all His commandments</strong> which I am commanding you today, that the Lord your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And <strong>all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God</strong>:
 <br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will you be in the city, and <strong>blessed</strong> will you be in the country.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will be your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
<strong>Blessed</strong> will you be when you come in, and <strong>blessed</strong> will you be when you go out.<br>
 <br>
But it shall come about, <strong>if you do not obey the Lord your God, to be careful to follow all His commandments</strong> and His rules which I am commanding you today, that all <strong>these curses will come upon you</strong> and overtake you.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will you be in the city, and <strong>cursed</strong> will you be in the country.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will be your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, the newborn of your herd, and the offspring of your flock.<br>
<strong>Cursed</strong> will you be when you come in, and <strong>cursed</strong> will you be when you go out.<br>
 <br>
The LORD shall smite you with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart.<br>
 <br>
I have <strong>placed before you today life and good and also death and evil</strong>. For I command you today to <strong>love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments</strong>, his rules, and his justice, <strong>that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you</strong>. I have <strong>placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse</strong>. Therefore <strong>choose life, that you may live, you and your seed</strong>, to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; <strong>for he is your life</strong>, and the length of your days.<br>
 <br>
-Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19,28 30:15-16,19-20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the New Testament, Jesus and his chosen disciples commanded followers of Jesus love and bless their enemies and not to hate and curse them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus taught them saying, “You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo; But I say to you, <strong>love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven</strong>; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</em><br>
-Matthew 5:43-45
 <br>
<em><strong>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse</strong></em>.<br>
-St. Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Romans 12:14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that throughout the verses of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick has used his words to call for the execution of the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and has been ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s commandments to love his enemies and bless those who have persecuted him, it is ironic that Kendrick is now praying for God to &ldquo;bless his words&rdquo; and &ldquo;bless how he think.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that the title for Kendrick&rsquo;s album, <em>DAMN.</em>, is shortening of the word &ldquo;damnation&rdquo; which is a synonym for &ldquo;curse.&rdquo; and the oppostive of a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;BLOOD.&rdquo; the first track on <em>DAMN.</em> opens a voice that presents a choice between life and death, similar to the choice that the Prophet Moses placed in front of the Israelites.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it wickedness?<br>
Is it weakness?<br>
<strong>You decide.<br>
Are we gonna live or die</strong>?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;YAH.&rdquo; the third track on <em>DAMN.</em>, Kendrick identifies himself as an Israelite and refers to a conversation in which his cousin Carl Duckworth told him that he was &ldquo;cursed&rdquo; based on Moses&rsquo;s speech from Deuteronomy about blessings and curses.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a Israelite</strong>, don&rsquo;t call me black no mo&rsquo;<br>
That word is only a color, it ain&rsquo;t facts no mo&rsquo;<br>
My cousin called, <strong>my cousin Carl Duckworth<br>
Said</strong> know my worth<br>
And <strong>Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo; the pivotal track on <em>DAMN.</em>, we hear a voicemail in which Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin Carl Duckworth quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and asserts that Kendrick is experiencing a cursed existence because he has not been following God&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What&rsquo;s up, family?<br>
Yeah, it&rsquo;s <strong>your cousin Carl, man, just givin&rsquo; you a call</strong>, man<br>
I know you been havin&rsquo; a lot on yo&rsquo; mind lately<br>
And I know you feel like, you know<br>
People ain&rsquo;t been prayin&rsquo; for you<br>
But you have to understand this, man, that <strong>we are a cursed people</strong><br>
<strong>Deuteronomy 28:28 says,<br>
&ldquo;The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart&rdquo;</strong><br>
See, family, <strong>that&rsquo;s why you feel like you feel</strong><br>
Like you got a chip on your shoulder<br>
<strong>Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way&hellip;</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Verse 2 says,<br>
&ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,<br>
therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities&rdquo;<br>
So <strong>until we come back to these commandments<br>
Until you come back to these commandments<br>
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse</strong><br>
Because He said He&rsquo;s gonna punish us<br>
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians<br>
Are the true children of Israel<br>
<strong>We are the Israelites, according to the Bible</strong><br>
The children of Israel<br>
<strong>He&rsquo;s gonna punish us</strong> for our iniquities, <strong>for our disobedience</strong><br>
Because we chose to follow other gods<br>
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee<br>
So, just like you chasten your own son, He&rsquo;s gonna chasten you<br>
<strong>Because He loves you</strong>, so that&rsquo;s why we get chastised<br>
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in the position that we&rsquo;re in<br>
<strong>Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments<br>
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us</strong><br>
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live<br>
Here, in today, in the United States of America<br>
I love you, family, and I pray for you<br>
God bless you<br>
Shalom</em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be asking God to make a distinction between himself and the “lame niggas&quot; who Kendrick wants God to keep away from him.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be requesting something that is similar to what God did when he rescured the Israelites from slavery.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to being resuced the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptian Pharaoh, who forced the Israelites to live in slave houses in a region near the capital of Egypt. When Pharaoah worried that the Israelite population was becoming too large, Pharaoh sent orders for soldier to kill every baby boy that was born to an Israelite mother.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God saved one Israelite boy named Moses and later called Moses to be a prophet. God then sent Moses to confront Pharaoh by telling him to let the Israelites go free. When Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God used Moses to send plagues ten different plagues which brough death and destruction upon Egypt.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the first nine plagues, God said that he was going to send a final tenth plague in which a spirit of death would pass through the capital of Egypt and the neighboring regions. This spirit of death would kill the first born sons and male animals of every household as a punishment for Pharaoh and the Egyptians killing the Israelties newborn sons.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since this plague of death was going to pass through the region of the Israelite slave houses, God told the Israelites that their sons and male animals would be spared for each Israelite houshold that celebrated a Passover (aka Pesach / Pascha) ritual meal. During the Passover meal, each Israelite family would kill a lamb, smear the blood on the posts and crossbar of their exterior door, and eat the lamb meat with unleavened bread. When the death spirit came across a door covered in lamb&rsquo;s blood it would “pass over” the house without killing the firstborn son or male animals.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God told Moses that by bringing death to the firstborn sons of Egypt while providing a way preserve the lives of the sons of Israel, God was created a line of separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. But against any of the children of Israel a dog won&rsquo;t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, *<em>that you may know that the LORD makes a line of separation</em> between the Egyptians and Israel.<br>
-Exodus 11:6-7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, by praying &ldquo;Dear God, draw the line&rdquo; and prevent anyone from confusing Kendrick with the &ldquo;lame niggas&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be asking God to kill the “lame niggas&quot; similar to how God sent the spirit of death to killsthe sons of the Egyptian who liked taking the innocent lives of the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the New Testament, the are several instances where Jesus does speak a future day where he will separate the righteous from the wicked.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about a land owner who instructs his servants to plant wheat seeds in a field. However, after the servants plant the wheat seeds, a deceptive adversary—who represents the [devil / satan / false accuser / diabolical one]—comes at night to plant seeds which will grow into weeds that look like wheat but do not produce any grain (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A24-30%2C36-43&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 13:24-30,36-43</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>When the wheat and the weeds begin to sprout up, the servants discover that someone has planted weeds among the wheat. The servants initially want to pull out all the weeds from the field. However, the land owner stops them.<br>
 </li>
<li>The land owner tells the servants that because the wheat and the weeds look very similar at this stage of their development, if the servants try to pull up the weeds they may accidentally pull up some of the wheat thinking that they are weeds. Moreover, since the wheat and the weeds are planted so close together, even if they can accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds, pulling up the weeds may uproot the wheat.<br>
 </li>
<li>The land owner tells the servants that it is not yet time to pull up the weeds. Instead, the land owner tells the servants to wait until the time of the harvest when all of the wehat has had the chance to be fruitful and produce grain. At that point, the servants will be able to accurately distinguish between the wheat and the weeds. The servants will then gather the wheat together and burn up the weeds to dispose of them.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus explains that this parable is a metaphor for the &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; at end of the world as we know it, when those who have lived lives with right relationships will be gathered together in God&rsquo;s new creation while the wicked are exclused from God&rsquo;s new creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be a kind of disobedient servant who refuses to listen to the land owner&rsquo;s instructions and is convinced that now is the time to pull out the weeds. If he continues to disobey the land owenrs instruction, Kendrick will end up destroying the lives of the those who will eventually produce good grain.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is particularly ironic that in the first verse Kendrick described himself as a &ldquo;the man that resides in patience&rdquo; but by saying &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to watch the party die&rdquo; Kendrick seems to be too impatient to wait for the time that the Lord has set to bring an end to wickedness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, Jesus tells another parable about the &ldquo;Last Judgement&rdquo; in which the Lord will be like a herder who takes a mixed herd of sheep and goats into the pastures. However, at the end of the day, the herder separates the sheep from the goats and places the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus explains that the sheep represent people who have maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need. In contrast, the goats represents people who have not maintained right relationships with others, especially those who are in need.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the parable, many of the people who turn out to be sheep are not aware that they did anything in thier lives that would cause them to be included among the sheep. Similarly, many of the people who turn out to be goats are not aware that they failed to do things that would have allowed them to be included among the sheep.<br>
 </li>
<li>The fact that the identity of the sheep and the goats is a surprise that is not revealed until the end of time as we know seems to suggest that all humans should not be quick to assume that someone else is a goat or assume that they themselves are sheep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, seems to be convinced that he is one of the sheep. However, by advocating to burn down entire villages and ignoring Jesus&rsquo;s commandments to love his neighbor, Kendrick is acting more like a goat who has failed to maintain right relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Forgiveness in the New Testament</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-the-new-testament">&ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin&rsquo; how hard I tried&rdquo; &gt; Forgiveness in the New Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-the-new-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s final request is for God to grant him forgiveness. In case God might not be included to forgive kendrick, Kendrick tried to justify himself by pointing out how hard he has tried to do what&rsquo;s right.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The request for God&rsquo;s forgviness echos the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, which includes the following request:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Forgive us</strong> our transgressions (i.e. violations of trust)<br>
<strong>as we forgive</strong> those who transgress against us (i.e. violate our trust)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After teaching his disciples the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Jesus specifically highlighted the request for forgiveness by making it clear that God would not forgive those who refuse to forgive others.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>If you forgive</strong> humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], <strong>your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive</strong> humans for their [transgressions / violations of trust], <strong>your Father will also not forgive your [transgressions / violations of trust]</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 6:14-15</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later on in St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel, one of Jesus&rsquo;s disciples asked how many times he should forgive a brother who has sdone something wrong to him. In response, Jesus told his disciples a parable which reflected on the for necessity for God&rsquo;s people to forgive other humans because God has already forgiven his people to a much greater degree (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A21-35&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 18:21-35</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>In this parable there is a king—representing God the Father—who has many servants—representing different humans, particularly followers of Jesus.<br>
 </li>
<li>One of these servants has somehow borrowed large amounts of money from the king and now owes the king what in today&rsquo;s currency would be equivalent to $8 billion dollars.<br>
 </li>
<li>When the king realizes how much money the servant owes him, the king announced plans to sell the servant into slavery along with the servant&rsquo;s wife and children in order to at least recuperate some money.<br>
 </li>
<li>The servant then falls on the ground and begs the king not to sell him into slavery. He even tells the king that he will repay the equivalent of $8 billion dollar that he owes.<br>
 </li>
<li>The king has compassion on the servant, releases him from his impending slavery and forgives all of the servants debts.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, immediately after having his debts forgiven, the first servant walks out of kings court and sees a second servant who owes the first servant what would be the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars.<br>
 </li>
<li>The first servant immedateily grabs the second servant by the neck, begins choking him and demands that the second servant pay him back.<br>
 </li>
<li>The second servant then falls on the ground and begs the first servant servant to be patient and he will repay the equivalent of $14 thousand dollars that he owes.<br>
 </li>
<li>However, the first servant refuses to forgive the second servant. Instead, the first servant throws the second servant into a debtors prison where the second servant will be forced for work for three or more months in order to pay the first servant back.<br>
 </li>
<li>Soon the king finds out what the first servant did to the second servant and calls the first servant back to his court. The king becomes angry with the first servant and strongly condemns him for refusing to forgive a $14 thousand dollar debt after the king had forgiven him much, much larger $8 billion dollar debt.<br>
 </li>
<li>The king then once again holds the first servant responsible for the $8 billion dollar debt. The king orders the first servant to be thrown into debtors prison until he has repaid the entire debt. This punishment is essentially a life sentence because it would take 164 thousand years of labor for the first servant to pay the king back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the Jesus&rsquo;s teaching on the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the parable of the unforgiving servant, it is deeply ironic that Kendrick is praying &ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me&rdquo; after he has refused to forgive Drake or anyone who has participated in &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and has even claimed &ldquo;this shit done got too wicked to apologize.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, based on Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, Kendrick&rsquo;s self-justification that God knows &ldquo;how hard I tried&rdquo; seems destined to fall on deaf ears and be rejected by God. Jesus dicussed how he would reject the pleas of individuls who claimed to do lots of things for God but refused to actually does God the Father.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jesus taught his disciple saying, &ldquo;<strong>Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Fathe</strong>r who is in heaven will enter. <strong>Many will say to Me</strong> on that day,<br>
 <br>
&lsquo;Lord, Lord, <strong>did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?</strong>&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
And then <strong>I will declare to them, &lsquo;I never knew you; leave Me, you who act against the law.</strong>&rsquo;&rdquo;</em><br>
 <br>
-Matthew 7:21-23</li>

<li>
<p>The need forgivness is a central theme within both <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “DNA.”, the second track of DAMN., Kendrick rapped about the fact his rough upbringing taught him so many things he needed to know to become successful in the would, but the one things that he wish he had received was to be nurtured in a way that would allow him to forgive others.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I know murder, conviction<br>
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption<br>
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and<br>
<strong>I wish I was fed forgiveness</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier&rsquo;s DNA</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme of monetary debts in the parable of the unforgiving servant also reminds us of the track “XXX.” from <em>DAMN.</em>, where Kendrick tells a story about his friend&rsquo;s son who was killed because of “insufficient funds”. When the friend called Kendrick and asked for spiritual guidance from an anointed Chrisitan, Kendrick ignores Jesus&rsquo;s teachings by saying that he would never forgive someone who harmed any one of his family members and the friend should not forgive either.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101<br>
Said <strong>they killed his only son because of insufficient funds</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
He said, &ldquo;K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me<br>
<strong>I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome</strong>&rdquo;<br>
He was lookin&rsquo; for some closure, <strong>hopin&rsquo; I could bring him closer<br>
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him</strong><br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel<br>
<strong>If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin&rsquo; killed</strong><br>
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of<br>
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch<br>
I wait in front a nigga&rsquo;s spot and watch him hit his block<br>
I catch a nigga leavin&rsquo; service if that&rsquo;s all I got<br>
<strong>I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong><br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman<br>
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother<br>
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first verse of “Mother I Sober” from <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick acknowledged his battles with sex addiction, infidelity, and violations of trust in his relationships with Whitney, his fiance and the mother of his children. As he reckoned with the pain that he had caused to an innocent soul, Kendrick asked God whether he could be forgiven for what he had done.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Intoxicated, <strong>there&rsquo;s a lustful nature</strong> that I failed to mention<br>
Insecurities that I project, <strong>sleepin&rsquo; with other women</strong><br>
<strong>Whitney&rsquo;s hurt, the purest soul I know</strong>, I found her in the kitchen<br>
<strong>Askin&rsquo; God</strong>, &ldquo;Where did I lose myself? And <strong>can it be forgiven?</strong>&rdquo;<br>
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, <strong>&ldquo;Is there an addiction?&rdquo;</strong><br>
I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but this time <strong>I lied</strong>, I knew that I can&rsquo;t fix it<br>
<strong>Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me</strong><br>
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme of forgivness is noticably been absent within the diss tracks that Kendrick released during his battle with Drake. Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick seems to fully reject the idea of forgiving anyone even as he prays for God to forgive him.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Forgiveness in Kendrick&rsquo;s cataloge</summary>
    
      <h4 id="dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-kendricks-cataloge">&ldquo;Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin&rsquo; how hard I tried&rdquo; &gt; Forgiveness in Kendrick&rsquo;s cataloge.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dear-god-please-forgive-me-you-knowin-how-hard-i-tried--forgiveness-in-kendricks-cataloge">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I do think it is important to point out that within the context of Bible, forgiveness does not mean that society, law enforcement or victims should allow a crime to go unpunished or—even worse—allow a perpetrator to continue harming the victim or other future victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This point is actually illustrated quite clearly by the Old Testament story of King David using his power to traffic a woman to his palace, force her to have sex with him, and then kill her husband to cover up a pregnancy. In that case, God sent a prophet to directly confront David about his evil and unjust actions. David admitted to being guilty under God&rsquo;s judgment, repented, was forgiven by God, and was spared from the death penalty. However, David&rsquo;s actions had real world consequences that led to the deaths of at least three of David&rsquo;s sons as well as a significant amount of societal shame which over time made countless numbers of men in David&rsquo;s time—along with later readers of the Bible—think twice about allowing uncontrolled sexual desire to lead them to coercing women or murdering people to cover up earlier acts of wickedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One can also look at the New Testament story from St. John account of the Gospel in which a woman who was caught while she was having sex in an adulterous relationship. Unlike the case of the woman with King David, she had apparently chosen to engage in this sexual relationship. She was then brought in front of an all-male court of Judean religious leaders who appealed to Jesus to serve as a trial judge who would sentence her to death under the rules laid out in laws given to Moses (See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A1-11&amp;version=NASB">John 8:1-11</a>).<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus sent all the accusers away by pointing out that they had themselves done things against the law of Moses that the Israelites were supposed to follow and thus should not feel that it was their right to condemn the woman to the death penalty.<br>
 </li>
<li>Jesus had not done any actions that broke the law of Moses, so he theoretically had the right to condemn the woman to the death penalty. However, he chose not to. Instead, Jesus told the woman, &ldquo;I do not condemn you. Go on your way. From now on, do not sin any more.”<br>
 </li>
<li>In this case, Jesus let the woman go free without any additional punishment beyond the societal shame that she had already experienced and would likely continue to experience. Jesus didn&rsquo;t totally take this consequence away, though he did mitigate it to some degree by pointing out the lawless actions of her accusers.<br>
 </li>
<li>Moreover, Jesus warned her by saying “do not sin any more”. This statement echos a previous statement from Jesus after Jesus healed a man and told that man “Now you have become well. Do not sin anymore or something worse will happen to you”.<br>
 </li>
<li>Hence, Jesus ultimate goal was for the woman not be immediatly killed for her wickedness but for her to find healing and be transformed in a way that she would be able to stop herself from acting in a way that would ruin her relationships and result in a negative final judgement at the end of time.</li>

<ul>
<li>After praying to God throughout most of the chorus, Kendrick ends the chorus by doubling down on the first line of the first verse. Kendrick further emphasizes his desire to execute the hosts and attendees of the party by saying &ldquo;watch the party die&rdquo; three times and adding the phrases &ldquo;send &rsquo;em home&rdquo; and &ldquo;get&rsquo;em gone&rdquo;, which are both slang phrases for killing someone.</li>

<ul>
<li>Kendrick begins the second verse with the same line from beginning of the first verse. Additionally, the chorus ended with Kendrick saying &ldquo;watch the party die&rdquo; three times. By continuing to repeat this phrase, Kendrick seems to be speaking like someone with an unhealthy obsession with vigilante justice.</li>

      <h4 id="street-niggas-and-the-corporate-guys-the-rappers-that-report-the-lies--street-niggas">&ldquo;Street niggas and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies&rdquo; &gt; Street niggas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#street-niggas-and-the-corporate-guys-the-rappers-that-report-the-lies--street-niggas">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be highlighting more people who should be executed for the benefit of society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Street niggas&quot; refer to young Black men who are engaged in selling drugs, hustling, robberies, gang banging or any other kind of illegal activity that is done to get money. These kinds of activities are statistically more common in densely populated, urbanized neighborhoods in major American cities where people are more likely to walk through the city on street sidewalks in contrast to American suburbs where many people exclusively drive from one place to another.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The illegal activities in which &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; often engage often lead to violence, murder and other casualties as Kendrick has detailed throughout much of his work, such as the track “Poe Man&rsquo;s Dreams” from <em>Section.80</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>My mama is stressin&rsquo;, my daddy tired<br>
<strong>I need me a weapon</strong>, these niggas ride<br>
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me<br>
How I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; listen when I don&rsquo;t even hear God?<br>
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts<br>
My hands dirty, you worried &lsquo;bout mud in your sink<br>
You like to mistake a <strong>street nigga</strong> for real nigga<br>
The <strong>same nigga that kill with you&rsquo;ll squeal with you</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since “street niggas&quot; typically depict themselves as people who like to kill others, they would likely be included among the peaople who Kendrick planned to execute when he said &ldquo;We even kill the killers &lsquo;cause they like taking innocent lives.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate guys&rdquo; likely refers to the entertainment industry&rsquo;s corporate employees who are paid to find ways of making money from music, films and other forms of entertainment. In many cases, their approach to making money is not in the best interest of the artist who makes the work, the audience who consumes the work, or the society in which the work is distibuted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case that &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; are trying to make money from the stories of &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo;, the resulting work may actually lead the audience to immitate behavior that leads some individuals to kill other individuals.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within both <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick has pointed out that corporate employees often hide their tendency to be killers and murderers while teaching their own deceptive philosophies to the youth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>It&rsquo;s murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br>
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br>
Homicidal thoughts</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;XXX.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run<br>
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage,<br>
<em>the market is crashin&rsquo;, the industry wants<br>
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box<br>
while they makin&rsquo; a mockery followin&rsquo; us</em></em><br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t Monopoly</strong>, watchin&rsquo; for love.<br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t monogamy. Y&rsquo;all gettin&rsquo; fucked</strong>*<br>
-&ldquo;N95&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
*<strong>I&rsquo;m a killer, he&rsquo;s a killer, she&rsquo;s a killer</strong>, bitch<br>
<strong>We some killers</strong>, walkin&rsquo; zombies, tryna scratch that itch<br>
&hellip;<br>
<em>Eight billion people on Earth, <strong>silent murderers</strong><br>
Non-profits, preachers and church? Crooks and burglars (Woo)<br>
<strong>Hollywood corporate in school, teachin&rsquo; philosophies</strong><br>
You either gon&rsquo; be dead or in jail, <strong>killer psychology</strong><br>
<strong>Silent murderer, what&rsquo;s your body count? Who your sponsorship?</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate guys&rdquo; may thus be complicit with those who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo; and for whom &ldquo;the graveyard is company&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Rather than &ldquo;givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;, &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; often appropriate the stories from &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; and package them in music made by &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On &ldquo;N95.&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick seemed to expose liars in the rap game and demand that they take off their lies like an actor taking off a mask.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You&rsquo;re back outside, but <strong>they still lied</strong><br>

<strong>Take off them fabricated streams</strong> and them microwave memes, it&rsquo;s a real world outside<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s also notable that in the battle tracks, Kendrick repeatedly called Drake a liar, actor, and manipulator who has tried to borrow stories and credibility from &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>famous actor</strong> we once knew is lookin&rsquo; paranoid and now is spiralin&rsquo;<br>

<ul>
<li>In addition to ordering the execution of the &ldquo;street niggas, corporate guys, and rappers that report the lies&rdquo;, Kendrick says that he &ldquo;needs&rdquo; the families of these individuals to be “mortified”. The word &ldquo;mortified&rdquo; refers to someone feeling ashamed, particularly when they are in the view of the public.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is notable that in early forms of English—from the 1300s to the 1700s—the word “moritiy” meant “to kill”. The word was originally derived from the Latin word “mortificō” which literally meant “to put to death”. In early forms of English, &ldquo;mortify&rdquo; was often used metaphorically to refer to the act of subduing, humbling, or humiliating someone.<br>
 </li>
<li>By using the word mortify, Kendrick subtly brings up the idea that the family of the street niggas, corporate guys, and lying rappers should also be killed. The idea of killing family members of excessively wicked individuals connects back to first verse where Kendrick told his supporters to “burn the whole village”.</li>

<li>Kendrick then seems to appeal to his supporters to join his roster of executioners and help in the process of organizing the dead bodies after carrying out the execution orders.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Pillow-talking&rdquo; refers to conversations that happen between couples while lying down in bed with their heads on pillows after having sex.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Certain hip hop media figures, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXtyIYSPadY&amp;t=596s">DJ Akademics</a>, have explained that arguments, hatred and information that is leveraged within rap battle often spreads because many rappers will often have sex with the same set of women. These women end up pillow-talking about the other rappers with whom they have had sex.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DJ Akademics—who is sometimes referred to as Ak&rsquo;—is also known for being a loyal supporter of Drake. Kendrick previously suggested that DJ Akademics is compromised on “6:16 in LA”.</p>

<p>The pillow-talking dynamic also exist among violent street niggas, which explains how pillow-talking could lead to neighborhood wars.<br>

<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;no more pillow-talkin&rsquo;&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be implying that he will be giving orders to execute the &ldquo;dirty-macking bitches&rdquo; who have attended &ldquo;the party&rdquo; or had sex with the street niggas, corporate guys or rappers that report the lies.</p>

<li>“Macking” refers to physical contact, conversations, or other flirtatious actions that a person does to flirt or attract someone with whom the person wants to have sex.<br>

<li>Dirty can be used to describe something that is dishonorable or something that is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.<br>
 </li>
<li>Here Kendrick seems to be criticizing the “dirty ackin&rsquo;” women and men whose &ldquo;pillow-talking&rdquo; is leading to neighborhood wars.<br>
 </li>
<li>Kendrick seems to suggest the reason why men or women get into these &ldquo;dirty-macking&rdquo;, &ldquo;pillow-talking&rdquo; sexual relationships because they are insecure men who need the validation of an attractive woman agreeing to have sex with them or insecure women who need the validation of a famous rapper expressing a strong desire to have sex with them.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, &ldquo;flashy&rdquo; is an adjective which describes someone who shows off or flaunts their wealth and possession. &ldquo;Flashy niggas&rdquo; might thus be included among those who &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of “dirty” from the previous line gets escalated to “nasty”, conveys a sense of repulsion or aversion. Both &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; are used as slang adjectives to describe someone who is overtly sexual, especially when expressing a desire for novelty and adventurous forms of sexual behavior.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; and &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; are both synonyms for the word &ldquo;freaky&rdquo; which Kendrick used when he described Drake as a &ldquo;freaky ass nigga&rdquo; and a &ldquo;69 god&rdquo;—in reference to an adventurous form of simultaneous oral sex-on &ldquo;Not Like Us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s criticism of &ldquo;the flashy nigga&rdquo; who is &ldquo;usin&rsquo; money as a backbone&rdquo; may also be applied to Drake. Within the battle, Kendrick accused Drake of acting like a tough &ldquo;street nigga&rdquo; even though he has no backbone and has to pass real street niggas to join his crew an be his &ldquo;backbone&rdquo;. However, as Kendrick pointed out, these &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; who are paid to be Drake&rsquo;s &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; are actually a liability because they are not truly loyal to Drake and are only around for the money.</p>

<p>Drake&rsquo;s strategy of paying &ldquo;street niggas&rdquo; and other tough guys to be part of his crew is well documented online most notably in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hgN3ze96zU">this video by HipHopMadness</a>.</p>

<p>Kendrick give even more specific instructions on how he wants the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; to be executed. In this case, he orders his executioners kill the condemned man by hitting him in the head with some kind of blunt weapon until the man&rsquo;s skull is cracked open.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick orders for the execution to happen while the condemned man is out of his house and before the condemned man ever has a chance to come back home that day. The immediacy of these orders further highlights the idea that &ldquo;it is time&rdquo; to watch the party die.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The specificity of these execution orders resembles &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; from <em>DAMN.</em> where Kendrick talked about how he would kill someone who had killed his son by waiting outside of the building where the killer was located and then gun the killer down at his first opportunity.</p>

<li>
<p>A &ldquo;radio personality&rdquo; is host of an radio program, podcast or other form of audio based content who publicly broadcasts his or her perspective on current events or popular culture.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propaganda is the deliberate dissemination of information, ideas, or messages that are often biased or misleading and are designed to influence public opinion, manipulate emotions, or promote a specific agenda or ideology. Propaganda is typically disseminated by powerful or influential political entity, government, industry or group who wants to influence the public in order to control their actions or hold on to power.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick implies that many of these &ldquo;radio personalities&rdquo; are getting paid to use their platform to disseminate propaganda on behalf of the entertainment industry or on behalf of the systems which mentally enslave Black people.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on his 2016 track, &ldquo;Hype&rdquo;, Drake boasts about creating his own propaganda.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I don&rsquo;t take this shit for granted<br>
<strong>I do my own propaganda</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the battle track &ldquo;6:16 in LA&rdquo;, Kendrick accuses Drake of &ldquo;playin&rsquo; dirty with propaganda&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>But let me tell you some game &lsquo;cause I can see you, my lil&rsquo; homie<br>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; was released, Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em> whose opening track &ldquo;wacced out murals&rdquo; mentions &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; and specifically criticies a White comedy podcast host who controvertially joked about Black women being emotionally disregulated and violent.</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick asserted that Hollywood&rsquo;s corporate leaders and employees are &ldquo;silent murderers&rdquo; who teach their deadly and deceptive philosophies in schools.</p>

<ul>
<li>In English the word &ldquo;casualty&rdquo; is used to refer to someone who has died—or in some cases someone who has been injured—during an act of violence such a war or a criminal attack.<br>
 </li>
<li>In the most narrow legal definition, &ldquo;assault&rdquo; is a crime in which a someone causes reasonable fear that they will cause physical harm to another person or make unwanted physical contact with another person. Meanwhile, &ldquo;battery&rdquo; is a crime in which someone actually causes physical harm or makes unwanted physical contact.<br>
 </li>
<li>The use of the terms &ldquo;assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;battery&rdquo; reminds us that the acts of all of these vigilante executions which Kendrick has ordered are illegal, criminal attacks.<br>
 </li>
<li>Moreover, by saying that he wants the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; to experience extreme physical and mental suffering or &ldquo;agony&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to not be satisfied with simply ridding society of wicked people. He seems to be expressing an unhealthy and sadistic enjoyment of knowing that wicked people will experience extreme suffering.</li>

      <h4 id="i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-the-new-testament">&ldquo;I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people&rdquo; &gt; New Earth in the New Testament<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-the-new-testament">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term “New Earth” originates from, &ldquo;The Revelation&rdquo;, the final book in the New Testament and the Bible in which St. John sees a prophetic, visionary “Revelation” from Jesus.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this prophetic vision, Jesus shows St. John how the oppression, persecution, violence and killings that Christians faced under various Roman Emperors from 64 to 100 AD are part of a much larger pattern of the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”] trying to bring death and destruction to those who follow Jesus as their Lord.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus encourages various church communities to “overcome” not by starting a revolution or killing their oppressors, but by forgiving and loving the humans who are acting like enemies, but are really just under the control of the true enemy—the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”].<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus encourages these persecuted church communities to trust that one day Jesus will defeat the true enemy. Moreover, Jesus promised that one day, God will bring an end to the world as it currently exists and bring about a &ldquo;New Heaven&rdquo; which fully overlaps with a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo;. In this overlapping &ldquo;New Heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; where all humans will know God, have a loving relationship with God, and obey God&rsquo;s commandments, which will lead to an eternal life of peace, justice and right relationships.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This transformation from the current Earth to the &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; is described in the second to last chapter of &ldquo;The Revelation&rdquo; where St. John describes the end of his vision by saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw <strong>a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away</strong>, and the sea is no more. I saw <strong>the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God</strong>, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, <strong>God&rsquo;s [tent / residence] is with humans, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; There will be no mourning, no crying, no pain, any more</strong>. The first things have passed away.”<br>
-Revelation 21:1-4</li>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">New Earth in New Age Spirituality</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-new-age-spirituality">&ldquo;I see a New Earth filled with beautiful people&rdquo; &gt; New Earth in New Age Spirituality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-see-a-new-earth-filled-with-beautiful-people--new-earth-in-new-age-spirituality">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>More recently, biblical concept of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; has also been encorporated into &ldquo;New Age&rdquo; spirituality.<br>
 </li>
<li>“New Age” spirituality is a somewhat fluid category of spiritual beliefs and practices that arose from the &ldquo;hippie&rdquo; and &ldquo;counterculture&rdquo; movement of the late 1960s. Teachers and practitioners of New Age spirituality blend Eastern spiritual traditions (e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism)\ with some aspects of Western Christianity and a modern, secular humanist ethos.<br>
 </li>
<li>After the initial popularity of New Age spirituality in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of New Age ideas in the late late 1990s and early 2000s due to the populaity of self-help psychology books by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle&rsquo;s is known best for his 1997 book <em>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment</em> and his 2005 book <em>A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&rsquo;s Purpose</em>.<br>
 </li>
<li>In 2008, the legendary Black talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, hosted Eckhart Tolle on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his book <em>A New Earth</em>. Oprah also added <em>A New Earth</em> to Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club and hosted a 10-week live online class series where Eckhart Tolle discussed <em>A New Earth</em> chapter by chapter.<br>
 </li>
<li>Similar fashion to other forms of New Age spirituality, <em>A New Earth</em> takes some ideas from the Bible, such as St. John&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;a New Heaven and a New Earth&rdquo; and subtly redefines it through the perspective of Eastern spiritual beliefs, practices, and terminology.<br>
 </li>
<li>In particular, <em>A New Earth</em> builds on the concepts from Tolle&rsquo;s previous book <em>The Power of Now</em> to focus on the Buddhist/Hindu idea that humans must go through an “ego death” so that their suffering will end and their individual identities (or the illusion of their individual identities) can melt away into a new, unified harmony with the universe. Within Tolle&rsquo;s writing, this ego death is  said to take place through practices such a Buddhist forms of emptying meditation that lead a person to awaken into a greater state of awareness or “consciousness” in moment or in the “now”.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>While the influence of Christianity has already been well documented throughout this analysis, it should also be noted that Eckhart Tolle has clearly had a significant influence on Kendrick&rsquo;s work beginning at least as early as 2021 when Kendrick released a video introducing his new media production company, pgLang. This introductory video contains imagery of meditative practices, a clock in which every hour is labeled as &ldquo;now&rdquo;, a scene were a young woman chooses &ldquo;NOW&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;PAST&rdquo; or &ldquo;FUTURE&rdquo;, and a scene were Kendrick sits across from Eckhart Tolle and listens intently as Tolle gives spiritual/psychologial guidance.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Eckhart Tolle is introduced as Kendrick&rsquo;s psychotherapist and a major contributor to the album.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kodak Black, Oklama<br>
<strong>Eckhart Tolle</strong><br>

Whitney:  <em><strong>You really need some therapy</strong>.</em><br>
Kendrick: <em>Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin&rsquo; about?</em><br>
Whitney:  <em>Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck.</em><br>
Kendrick: <em>Shit, everybody stupid.</em><br>
Whitney:  <em>Yeah, well, <strong>you need to talk to somebody. Reach out to Eckhart.</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Father Time&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eckhart Tolle&rsquo;s voice is heard on several occasions on the second half of <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mr. Duckworth&hellip;</em><br>
-&ldquo;Count Me Out&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let&rsquo;s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you&hellip;</em><br>
-&ldquo;Savior (Interlude)&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>This is how we conceptualize human beings</em><br>
-&ldquo;Auntie Diaries&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>People get taken over by this pain-body, because this energy field that almost has a life of its own—it needs to periodically feed on more unhappiness.</em><br>
-&ldquo;Mr. Morale&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the last verse of &ldquo;Rich Spirit&rdquo;, ends with Kendrick specifically referencing the &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; after making references to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and other New Age concepts earlier in an the track.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Takin&rsquo; my baby to school, then <strong>I pray for her</strong><br>
&lsquo;Cause you bitches ain&rsquo;t never been cool, <strong>writin&rsquo; testament</strong><br>
Paintin&rsquo; pictures, put me in the Louvre, that&rsquo;s a definite<br>
<strong>Universal shift</strong>, I&rsquo;m in a groove<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>The aloof Buddha, I&rsquo;m Christ with a shooter<br>

&hellip;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m fasting four days out the week</strong>, brother<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>The New Earth</strong> in hot pursuit, <strong>two-hundred lives</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether Kendrick is currently seeing a vision of the traditional Christian understanding of a “New Earth” or the New Age version, the reference to a peaceful &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; is in sharp contrast to the increasingly violent rhetoric that Kendrick is using throughout the verse.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be implying that the end goal of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; justifies the means of violent and inhumane vigilante executions. This &ldquo;ends-justify-the-means&rdquo; logic twists the prophetic vision of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; into dystopian, totalitarian vision of a bloody revolution and political purge.</p>

<ul>
<li>After ordering the executions of social media influencers on the previous verse, Kendrick is now adding the followers of those influencers to the execution list.<br>
 </li>
<li>In particular he calls out the follower who are “poppin mollies”. &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; is slang for the pure, molecular—from which we get the name molly—form of psychoactive drug MDMA. This pure form of MDMA is distinguished from the drug ecstasy in which MDMA is mixed with other substances.<br>
 </li>
<li>MDMA increases heart rate, makes users feel more energetic, induces increased emotional and sensory experience, increases feelings of connection and empathy and overall leads to feelings of euphoria. However, these positive feelings can lead to an emotional crash and increased anxiety after the effects of the drug wears off.<br>
 </li>
<li>MDMA was originally used in the 1970s to assist with psychotherapy for conditions such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, by the 1980s forms of MDMA and eventually molly began to be used as a “party drug” at raves, electronic music concerts and other dance parties. Molly&rsquo;s status as a “party drug” connects to the recurring motif of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; throughout “Watch the Party Die”.<br>
 </li>
<li>Molly has also been referenced in the lyrics of a countless number of songs by &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;parade in gluttony without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>It seems that Kendrick now wants to execute the followers who have been using mollie in order to prevent the usage of the drug from spreading to other innocent lives and negatively affective society.</li>

<ul>
<li>The “followers” who are “poppin mollie” seems to be following the influence of people who Kendrick describes as “degenerates”. The word &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; refers morally corrupt people or more generally to people who have lost desirable physical, mental or social characteristics.<br>
 </li>
<li>Labeling a certain group of people with a term like “degenerates” has historicaly been a propaganda strategy for totalitarian rulers to justify eliminating certain cultural influences or killing off certain group of people.
 </li>
<li>Most notably, in the Nazi Party in Germany began to describe modern art with the term &ldquo;Entartete Kunst&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Degenerate Art&rdquo;. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany because such art was deemed &ldquo;an insult to German feeling&rdquo;. The Nazi party also ran a propaganda campaign against &ldquo;Degenerate Music&rdquo; which specifically targeted jazz music due to its &ldquo;Negroid excesses in tempo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jewishly gloomy lyrics.&rdquo;<br>
 </li>
<li>Given that Nazi propaganda would have labeled Kendrick&rsquo;s own form of hip hop music as &ldquo;Degenerate Music&rdquo;, it is ironic that Kendrick is not labeling other media influencers as degenerates and executing them alongside &ldquo;the radio personality pushin’ propaganda for salary&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick again seems to be highlighting the hope of a &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; that can be created after all of the wicked hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; are elimiated from society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be implying that the &ldquo;degenerates&rdquo; among the media influencers are spreading cynical criticism of Kendrick&rsquo;s message of hope. This assessement is conistent with the lines from the first verse where Kendrick said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Influencers talk down &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not with the basic shit</strong><br>
But they don&rsquo;t hate me, <strong>they hate the man that I represent</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because these influencers have been talking down at Kendrick and failing to talk positively about the hope that Kendrick and his supporters are trying to spread through Kendrick&rsquo;s music, Kendrick has included these influencers among those who will be viciously executed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick&rsquo;s campaign of totalitarian executions seems to be taking place that is a nominal democracy. Elections are still being held and Kendrick could theoretically be voted out of power. However, if anyone tries to oppose him by running an effective opposition campain or even casting a vote for the opposition, Kendrick wants such a person to be beheaded.<br>
 </p>
</li>

<p>This kind of election where voters are not free to cast their vote without suffering retribution for voting against the ruling party is often referred to as a &ldquo;sham election&rdquo;.<br>

<p>Months before the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; in March of 2024, the United States and other Western European allies denounced Russia&rsquo;s presidential election as a &ldquo;sham election&rdquo; after Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President of Russia with 88% of vote, which happed to be the highest percentage vote in the history of Russian democracy.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s re-election follows more than a decade in which political opposition leaders have been harrassed, silenced, imprisoned and assasinated. The most recent casualty was Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian prison under suspicious circumstances in February of 2024, just a month before the election.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the track &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick specifially highlighted Vladimir Putin as an example of oppresive leadership after he invaded Ukraine in Febrary of 2022 after claiming that Ukraine was governed by a neo-Nazi regime.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vladimir making nightmares<br>
But that&rsquo;s how we all think</strong><br>
The collective conscious<br>
Calamities on repeat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Kendrick did highlight Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s destructive behavior on &ldquo;Savior&rdquo;, Kendrick overall point seemed to be that Vladimir Putin is not unique or even outside of the norm. Instead, Kendrick asserted that Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s behavior simply reveals the way that all of us natrually think. Here on &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick proudly expresses this collective way thought as he seeks to eliminate anyone who does not support his vigilante campaign.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Bring his head</summary>
    
      <h4 id="you-need-to-bring-his-fuckin-head-or-film-that-shit-in-hi-res--bring-his-head">&ldquo;you need to bring his fuckin&rsquo; head or film that shit in hi-res&rdquo; &gt; Bring his head<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#you-need-to-bring-his-fuckin-head-or-film-that-shit-in-hi-res--bring-his-head">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Kendrick again exhibits sadistic tendencies as he demands to see the decapitated head of the person who did not vote for Kendrick. The executioners must either bring the decapitated head to Kendrick to see or they must film the decapitation in a high resolution video format so that Kendrick can see all of the small details when he watches the recording.<br>
 </li>
<li>It is also notable that the Gospel accounts of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke all tell the story about a wicked queen who conspires to have the king order the beheading of a John, the great prophet who baptized Jesus. Moreover, she got the king to bring John&rsquo;s head to her on a dinner platter.<br>
 
<ul>
<li>John the Baptist was Jesus&rsquo;s cousin and was highly respected prophet who called the Israelites to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (i.e. change their way of thinking) and be baptized. John also spoke out against the unjust actions of powerful figures including Herod, the puppet king of a Roman-controlled, Israelite region called Galilee.<br>
 </li>
<li>John the Baptist publicly criticized King Herod, telling him that it was not right or just for him to take his own brother&rsquo;s wife, Herodias, so that he could marry her for himself.<br>
 </li>
<li>The new queen, Herodias, became very angry at St. John the Baptist and got King Herod to arrest John. Still the queen was not satisfied with just arresting St. John. She wanted him to be killed even though the king was very reluctant to do so. Queen Herodias then looked for a way to kill the prophet John, much like Queen Jezebel looked for a way to kill the prophet Elijah.<br>
 </li>
<li>Then when King Herod threw a birthday party for himself, the queen sent her daughter to dance for Herodias and his guests at the party. The queen&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s dancing was apparently so stimulating and pleasurable for King Herod that without thinking he made an oath in front of all his guests that he would give the queen&rsquo;s daughter whatever she wanted.<br>
 </li>
<li>The daughter consulted with her mother, who immediately told her to ask the king to bring her the head of John the Baptist on a dinner platter. The king was sad and upset with himself because he really didn&rsquo;t want to kill John, but because he had made the oath in front of his guests and was too proud to look dishonorable by going back on his word, he agreed. He immediately ordered soldiers to decapitate John the Baptist and bring the head on a platter to the daughter who then presented it to the queen.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that John the Baptist was decapitated due to a party where a younger girl danced in a sensual way to gratify a group of powerful men brings us back to the motif of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; and the alleged trafficing of underage girls for sex parties at Drake&rsquo;s mansion.<br>
 </li>
<li>At the same time, by demanding for his executionors to bring him a the head of the man who refused to vote for him, Kendrick, the King of LA, is now playing the role of King Herod and Queen Herodias who unjustly killed the prophet, John the Baptist.</li>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Lecrae</summary>
    
      <h4 id="sometimes-i-wonder-what-lecrae-would-do--lecrae">&ldquo;Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do&rdquo; &gt; Lecrae<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sometimes-i-wonder-what-lecrae-would-do--lecrae">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here for the first time in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to reconsider whether he is doing the right thing by executing the hosts and attendees of &ldquo;the party&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular Kendrick wonders whether Lecrae, a famous Christian rapper, would pray for the hosts and attendees of the party or &ldquo;fuck these niggas up&rdquo; by violently assaulting them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae happens to be the most famous and successful artist in the history of the Christian hip hop (aka CHH). Christian hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that utilizes similar production, rapping and singing styles as mainstream hip hop. However, unlike mainstream hip hop, Christian hip hip is committed to presenting lyrics that help people understand and identify with Christian values, beliefs, and behavior.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the necessary commitment to Christian values, beliefs and behavior, artists that are accepted as part of Christian hip hop will not make songs that glorify scamming, gluttony, sexual promiscuity or criminal activity. In fact it is very rare for Christian hip hip artists to release music with any words that would be considered explicit: including profanity, sexual terminology or racial slurs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the high moral and behavioral expectations that come with being a Christian hip hop artis, Lecrae had a rough upbriging that was similar to many mainstream hip hop artists.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae never met his father and was raised by a single mother in a low income, urban, Black neighborhood. He was not raised as a Christian but became a very committed Christian later in life. That background has allowed Lecrae to speak to the reality of &ldquo;street life&rdquo; while also being able to clearly articulate Jesus&rsquo;s teaching in language that is accessible to urban, Black audiences.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to Kendrick on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, <em>DAMN.</em> and <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Lecrae has also publicly wrestled with his faith in God, hypocrisy among Christian leaders including himself, depression, personal struggles with addiction, and the weight of serving as a leader in a Black community facing various social issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Last year I was feeling hopeless<br>
I just wanted it to end</strong><br>
People stealing money from me, man<br>
I swear I thought that we was friends<br>
<strong>And I was so depressed, I was such a mess<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t shake it off<br>
Another murder on the television</strong><br>
Man, somebody go turn it off<br>
<strong>I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it<br>
Thought these people had my back boy<br>
Then they tellin&rsquo; me I asked for it<br>
I guess I&rsquo;m just another black boy<br>
And then they killed Tamir Rice</strong><br>
And they just go on with they life<br>
They tellin&rsquo; me shut up talking &lsquo;bout it<br>
Like, I should just talk about Christ<br>
But <strong>the truth is I started to doubt God<br>
I started to question my purpose<br>
I started to act out</strong><br>
I ain&rsquo;t wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile<br>
<strong>Doctors told me that my man died<br>
I almost had a breakdown
So tell depression it can fly away<br>
Tell my doubts that they can die today</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ma catch me a wave, sail away<br>
Can&rsquo;t stop me now</em><br>
-&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Stop Me Now (Destination)&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>I would speak at churches, hang with leaders and such<br>
You know, Judah, Piper, and Keller, Tony Evans was clutch<br>
<strong>I was so involved, never thought that I could fall</strong>, y&rsquo;all<br>
Right before the fall of 2015, I was all off<br>
<strong>It involved killing Michael Brown, had me feeling down</strong><br>
Tweeted &lsquo;bout it, Christians call me clown, I was losing ground<br>
And Voddie was a hero of mine, met with him plenty times<br>
This time, when he spoke, it cut me deeper than I realized<br>
Doubled-down, spoke about my pain, I was met with blame<br>
&ldquo;Shame on you, &lsquo;Crae, stop crying, get back to Jesus&rsquo; name&rdquo;<br>
<strong>Cut me deep, I was losing sleep</strong>, &ldquo;God, ain&rsquo;t these Your sheep?&rdquo;<br>
Why they hate me like they do? Maybe grace is really cheap<br>
Maybe this is all a lie, they don&rsquo;t really love me<br>
They just love it when I say the things they wanna hear in public<br>
They&rsquo;re like following they God mean turnin&rsquo; on Black people<br>
Is Black evil? <strong>Why do they hate and attack people?</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m vulnerable and cautious, I&rsquo;m reading Baldwin<br>
Ta-Nehisi got me thinking, now I&rsquo;m going all in<br>
<strong>I ain&rsquo;t know if God was real no mo&rsquo;<br>
Every day we gettin&rsquo; killed and I can&rsquo;t deal no mo&rsquo;<br>
I started slipping in the darkness, I&rsquo;m feeling heartless<br>
Christians got me traumatized, I don&rsquo;t know who God is<br>

Maybe I should get divorced</strong>, I don&rsquo;t know why she married me<br>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the purpose? What&rsquo;s the point?<br>
Nothing matters, I&rsquo;m just matter, I&rsquo;m just atoms<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no Eve and ain&rsquo;t no Adam<br>
Where the Xannies? Let me at &rsquo;em<br>
I was floating in confusion until I dropped<br>
Woke up in a clinical depression, then it all stopped</strong></em>
-&ldquo;Deconstruction&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given his background and spiritual perspective, Lecrae seems to be the perfect person to provide Kendrick with a perspective on whether Kendrick should rely on prayer or use violence to improve society.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also notable that prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Lecrae released a <a href="https://youtu.be/y2ZC1FEk87Q?si=syqzXoAhmBaRGzAv">podcast episode</a> in which he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the podcast episode, Lecrae accepted that rap battles as an established part of hip hop culture. Since Lecrae grew up with hip hop culture, he was  reluctant to criticize rap battles in and of themselves.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae also acknowledged that Kendrick was providing Drake with some feedback that he probably needed to hear.</p>
<p><em>We all need friends like Kendrick who are willing to tell us about ourselves. I never want to have to run into somebody in a rap battle to tell me the truth about myself.</em><br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Lecrae did express his concern that the way that Kendrick and Drake approached the rap battle (and to some extent how most rappers approach rap battles) demonstrates an unhealthy attempt to build their own sense of value and self-worth based on their ability to beat down another person.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Prayer was a major motif within <em>DAMN.</em>. Throughout that album, Kendrick repeatedly lamented that fact that no one was praying for him. However, at a pivotal point of the album,  Kendrick&rsquo;s cousin, Carl Duckworth, left a voicemail telling Kendrick that the cursed existence that he was experiencing was not due to a lack of people praying for Kendrick but due to a lack of Kendrick following God&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>New Kung Fu Kenny<br>
<strong>Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me</strong><br>

Bitch, all my grandmas dead<br>
So <strong>ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me, I&rsquo;m on your head</strong>, ayy</em><br>
-&ldquo;ELEMENT.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Shit I feel like<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo; for me<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nobody prayin&rsquo;<br>
&hellip;<br>
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for &rsquo;em<br>
But who the fuck prayin&rsquo; for me?</strong></em>
-&ldquo;FEEL.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Nobody pray for me</strong><br>
It been that day for me</em><br>
-&ldquo;HUMBLE.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>What&rsquo;s up, family? Yeah, it&rsquo;s your cousin Carl, man, just givin&rsquo; you a call, man. I know you been havin&rsquo; a lot on yo&rsquo; mind lately and <strong>I know you feel like, you know people ain&rsquo;t been prayin&rsquo; for you but you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people</strong>. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, &ldquo;The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness, and astonishment of heart.&rdquo; See, family, <strong>that&rsquo;s why you feel like you feel, like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way</strong>&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Verse 2 says, &ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities&rdquo;. So <strong>until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse</strong>, because He said He&rsquo;s gonna punish us. The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel - He&rsquo;s gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods. &ldquo;That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee.&rdquo; So, just like you chasten your own son, He&rsquo;s gonna chasten you, because He loves you. So that&rsquo;s why we get chastised. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in the position that we&rsquo;re in. <strong>Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us. We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live, here, in today, in the United States of America</strong>. I love you, family, and I pray for you. God bless you. Shalom.</em><br>
-&ldquo;FEAR.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>DAMN.</em> thus conveys the idea that prayer is insufficient if individual do not change the way that they live and begin to follow God&rsquo;s commandments. This idea about the need to follow God&rsquo;s commandments and help other to follow God&rsquo;s commandments might thus present a third way as opposed to exclusively praying or exclusively “fucking these niggas up.”</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic; font-size: 24px;">I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1</summary>
    
      




<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--dee-1-exposes-the-satanic-music-industry">&ldquo;I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1&rdquo; &gt; Dee-1 exposes the satanic music industry<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--dee-1-exposes-the-satanic-music-industry">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dee-1 is another Christian hip hop artist whose career has run in paralle to Lecrae&rsquo;s. Dee-1&rsquo;s first mixtape was released in 2004, the same year that Lecrae released his first album. However, Dee-1 has not come close to acheiving the level success or influence that Lecrae has had throughout his career.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part of this gap in success could be attributed to skill level and artistic choices. However, from Dee-1&rsquo;s perspective a big part of the gap in success is due to the fact that Dee-1 has been uncompromising in his commitment to deliver music with a clear Christian message and a willingness to call out issues in hip hop culture and the music industry that he sees as being misaligned with Jesus&rsquo;s teaching.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a timing and perspective that runs almost parallel to Katt Williams, Dee-1 gave given an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9subKGoAz8">interview</a> in January of 2024 where he discussed how he has been denied opportunities from entertainment industry &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo; because he wouldn&rsquo;t compromize his own integrity. Most notably, Dee-1 talked about haveing to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to powerful men in the entertainment industry who tried to coerce him into performing oral sex or receiving anal sex in order to receive a record deal.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>There&rsquo;s gatekeepers. So <strong>if you&rsquo;re trying to get signed to a major label, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers. If you&rsquo;re trying to get on certain media platforms to get interviewed, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers. If you trying to get on the mainstream radio, urban radio, there&rsquo;s gatekeepers</strong>. Yes. Yes. Yes.<br>
 <br>
I will say one last thing about gatekeepers—<strong>the only true gatekeeper to what&rsquo;s meant for you in this world is God and your level of integrity</strong>. That&rsquo;s the only two gatekeepers, because what&rsquo;s meant for you and what you want that&rsquo;s two different things and a lot of times people end up wanting things that ain&rsquo;t of God. Now <strong>if you want something that ain&rsquo;t of God, you got to go through gatekeepers&hellip;, who really ain&rsquo;t nobody in in the big scheme of things on the totem pole of people with integrity and people with morals values and principles</strong>. These gatekeepers ain&rsquo;t nobody, <strong>but in this perverted sick twisted industry these gatekeepers do hold access to certain levels</strong>, you know.<br>
 <br>
Bro, <strong>I&rsquo;ve had gatekeepers in the music industry who have literally tried to hold a record deal behind their back and let me know like, &ldquo;Look,if you a part of this homosexual act that I&rsquo;m trying to take part in, this door open real quick fory you.&rdquo; I got a song where I&rsquo;ve talked about that before called &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Playground.&rdquo;</strong> This is real dog and the only way that that type of stuff can work on you is if you let them have all the leverage to where you want what&rsquo;s behind that gate that bad. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a real thing.<br>
 <br>
You also got people—<strong>this a different type of gatekeeper—the gatekeepers who will say, &ldquo;Hey you making too much righteous noise right now. If you just tone that righteousness down a little bit then we&rsquo;ll allow you into these doors, but you got to tone that down. You got to becomea little more vanilla, a little more lukewarm, a little more bland and you&rsquo;ll fit in with us. That&rsquo;s the slick gatekeeping. It ain&rsquo;t telling you to all the way, you know, bend over or or open your mouth or something like that. It ain&rsquo;t that, but it&rsquo;s telling you like dim your light.</strong> And what ends up happening is you got so many people that&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not that bad. They not asking me to do nothing super crazy I just got to dim my light.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the scariest kind right there &lsquo;cause a lot of people will be like, &ldquo;Wait I just got to turn it from level 10 to level 5? Man, bet. I could do that. Bro, all right, bet. Now I get accepted. Cool.&rdquo; <strong>Next thing, you know you got a whole industry that&rsquo;s lukewarm—whole industry lukewarm, so that when somebody that&rsquo;s on fire come along they looking at it like, &ldquo;Whoa, you crazy! Hold on. You shining too bright</strong>. Hold on. Hold on. Chill out, man. You doing the most. You messing up, man. Stop man.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned in that interview, back in 2017, Dee-1 released a track called &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo; in which he mentioned having to say no to powerful man in music industry who offered to manage Dee-1 if Dee-1 would have sex with him. Dee-1 highlighted this experience as an example of how the entire music industry is under the control of Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accuser&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Lucifer laughs when he listens to the radio<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Dee-1&rsquo;s claim that the music industry is under the control of Lucifer / the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; is a view that Kendrick has also expressed going back to 2015 with the tracks &ldquo;Alright&rdquo; and &ldquo;For Sale? (Interlude)&rdquo; from *To Pimp a Butterfuly&quot;. In those tracks, Kendrick rapped from the perspective of a music industry leader named &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, short for Lucifer, who approach Kendrick and offered Kendrick wealth, success, and material possessions if Kendrick would sell his soul to her.</p>
<ul>

&lsquo;Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified<br>
That I (Want you)</strong><br>
You said <strong>Sherane ain&rsquo;t got nothing on Lucy</strong><br>
I said, &ldquo;You crazy?&rdquo;<br>
Roses are red, violets are blue<br>
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (Want you)<br>
&hellip;<br>
You said to me, <strong>you said your name was Lucy</strong><br>
I said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ricardo?&rdquo;<br>
You said, &ldquo;Oh, no, not the show&rdquo;<br>
Then you spit a little rap to me like this<br>
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, &ldquo;Oh, shit&rdquo;<br>
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:<br>
<strong>&ldquo;My name is Lucy, Kendrick</strong>, you introduced me, Kendrick<br>
Usually I don&rsquo;t do this but <strong>I see you and me, Kendrick<br>
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories<br>
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; fill your pockets<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; move your mama out of Compton<br>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br>
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?<br>
It&rsquo;s not so easy, I&rsquo;m at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don&rsquo;t slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon&rsquo; call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I&rsquo;m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don&rsquo;t mind, &lsquo;cause at the end of the day you&rsquo;ll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that&rsquo;s possible&rdquo;</strong></em><br>

<p>Moreover, a few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick released the album <em>GNX</em> which centers around the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; where Kendrick retells the biblical narrative pattern of &ldquo;Lucifer&rdquo;. In Kendrick&rsquo;s retelling, Lucifer is a fallen angel who has been reincarnated numerous times in the form of various musicians whose gluttony led them to use their musical skills and influence to deceive the masses and mentally enslave them under Lucifer&rsquo;s control.</p>

<li><em>I did <strong>past life regression</strong> last year and it fucked me up<br>
<strong>Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus<br>
Body after body</strong>, lesson after lesson, let&rsquo;s take it <strong>back to Michigan in 1947<br>
My father kicked me out the house &lsquo;cause I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to him</strong><br>
I didn&rsquo;t care about his influence, only loved what I was doing<br>
<strong>Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level<br>
The most talented where I&rsquo;m from, but I had to rebel</strong><br>
And so I&rsquo;m off in the sunset, searchin&rsquo; for my place in the world<br>
With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled<br>
<strong>I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect<br>
While the record business loved me<br>
I was head of rhythm and blues<br>
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose<br>
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses<br>
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Another life had placed me as a Black woman</strong> in the Chitlin&rsquo; Circuit<br>
<strong>Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains<br>
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed<br>
A musical genius</strong> what the articles emphasized<br>
<strong>Had everything I wanted, but I couldn&rsquo;t escape addiction<br>
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted</strong><br>
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be<br>
<strong>Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity<br>
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments<br>
I needed drugs</strong>, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin<br>
<strong>Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar<br>
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo;</strong><br>
My first assistant was a small town scholar<br>
Never did a Quaalude &rsquo;til I got myself around her<br>
<strong>My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me<br>
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>My present life is Kendrick Lamar<br>
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe</strong><br>
The only factor I respected was raisin&rsquo; the bar<br>
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh<br>
<strong>My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him<br>
I&rsquo;m old enough to understand the way I was livin&rsquo;<br>
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment</strong><br>
I close my eyes, hoping that I don&rsquo;t come off contentious<br>
I&rsquo;m yelling, &ldquo;Father, did I finally get it right?&rdquo; Everything I did was selfless<br>
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them<br>
I didn&rsquo;t gloat, even told &rsquo;em, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when the vultures came<br>
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed<br>
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed<br>
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself<br>
Father, I&rsquo;m not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down<br>
&ldquo;But <strong>your pride has to die</strong>,&rdquo; okay, Father, show me how<br>
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for<br>
I kept one hundred institutions paid<br>
Okay, tell me more<br>
I put one hundred hoods on one stage<br>
Okay, tell me more<br>
I&rsquo;m tryna push peace in L.A.<br>
But you love war<br>
No, I don&rsquo;t<br>
Oh, yes, you do<br>
Okay, then tell me the truth<br>
<strong>Every individual is only a version of you<br>
How can they forgive when there&rsquo;s no forgiveness in your heart?</strong><br>
I could tell you where I&rsquo;m going<br>
<strong>I could tell you who you are<br>
You fell out of Heaven &lsquo;cause you was anxious<br>
Didn&rsquo;t like authority, only searched to be heinous<br>
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent<br>
My greatest music director was you</strong><br>
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues<br>
It was harmony and motion<br>
<strong>I sent you down to earth &lsquo;cause you was broken<br>
Rehabilitation, not psychosis</strong><br>
But now we here now<br>
<strong>Centuries you manipulated man with music<br>
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving<br>
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views</strong><br>
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval<br>
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear<br>
The more that word is diminished, the more it&rsquo;s not real<br>
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel<br>
I&rsquo;m using words for inspiration as an idea<br>
So can you promise that you won&rsquo;t take your gifts for granted?<br>
I promise that I&rsquo;ll use my gifts to bring understanding<br>
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?<br>
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now<br>
<strong>You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m ashamed that I ever created that enemy<br>
Then let&rsquo;s rejoice where we at<br>
<strong>I rewrote the devil&rsquo;s story just to take our power back, &lsquo;carnated</strong></em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Prior to the release of “Watch the Party Die”, Dee-1 released a podcast episode which discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake. In comparison to Lecrae&rsquo;s podcast, Dee-1 was much more willing to directly criticize Drake, Kendrick and the culture of rap battles as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Dee-1&rsquo;s uncompromising perspective, the entire battle between Kendrick and Drake has glorified negative examples of hatred and unrighteous relationships that are a detriment to the Black community and misaligned with Jesus&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dee-1 also released an uncompromising response to “Watch the Party Die” in the form a track titled “Call It Like It Is”.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1<br>
But I will—<br>
<strong>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t care what these people think, I&rsquo;m trying to make these people think<br>
What&rsquo;s up, Kendrick?</strong> We flippin&rsquo; tables, man, (Call it like it is), alright<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Y&rsquo;all done turned this culture trash, these so-called legends ain&rsquo;t no legends<br>
I don&rsquo;t care if they sold millions, are you hearin&rsquo; their message?<br>
Poisonin&rsquo; our whole community, everybody hypnotized</strong><br>
Why you think nobody respect black people? No big surprise<br>
(Call it like it is) and <strong>I love New Orleans, my city<br>
But I love God way more, I don&rsquo;t care if none of y&rsquo;all with me<br>
We celebrate bein&rsquo; stupid and everybody so gangster</strong><br>
But when you clockin&rsquo; for that white man, you be on your best behavior, hold up<br>
(Call it like it is) Yeah, most of the media people laugh<br>
Y&rsquo;all was never really, really cool before you got inside this here game<br>
Instigating, y&rsquo;all bein&rsquo; messy, <strong>you ain&rsquo;t helping nobody grow</strong><br>
Tell Joe Budden I&rsquo;m on a mission, so don&rsquo;t butt in, Joe<br>
Man, I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; (Call it like it is), no, it ain&rsquo;t no pressure on me<br>
I&rsquo;m applyin&rsquo; the pressure, <strong>I&rsquo;m powered by G-O-D<br>
And we gon&rsquo; be alright, that&rsquo;s what Kendrick Lamar said</strong><br>
And in the words of Lil Wayne, the sky is the limit, yeah<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>So call it like it is, call it what it ain&rsquo;t</strong><br>
Call it what you want, no, I ain&rsquo;t on that train<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; from the soul, and I don&rsquo;t care who feel&rsquo; it<br>
Yeah, hip-hop is dead, and y &lsquo;all the ones who killed it</strong><br>
No, I am not impressed nah, and I say that with my chest (Uh-huh)<br>
Don&rsquo;t try to call me preaching, refer to me as blessed<br>
So call it like it is and call it what it ain&rsquo;t (ain&rsquo;t)<br>
So call it what you want (want), no, I ain&rsquo;t on that train<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Y&rsquo;all boys claim to be some soldiers<br>
But you soldiers ain&rsquo;t no soldiers</strong>, man, I told you and I showed you<br>
I&rsquo;m a soldier for life, stop playin&rsquo; dumb, <strong>it&rsquo;s good versus evil, it&rsquo;s only two sides</strong><br>
Class in session, y&rsquo;all need to attend, just like my shoe size<br>
Murder music hit different when somebody in my crew died<br>
The biggest gangsters in rap got blonde hair &rsquo;n&rsquo; blue eyes<br>
<strong>We gettin&rsquo; pimped, what y&rsquo;all wanna do, guys?<br>
Your new single just dropped? (Yeah) Time to entertain us with new lies</strong><br>
Whoever said I&rsquo;m canceled, man, I&rsquo;m laughing in these people&rsquo;s face<br>
<strong>I work for God, dummy, my impact could never be erased</strong><br>
Tell America, <strong>I&rsquo;m the same brother I used to be<br>
Before y&rsquo;all was introduced to me, consistency ain&rsquo;t new to me</strong><br>
(So call it like it is) <strong>Y&rsquo;all just sold us all with your foolery<br>
And that dollar bill got y &lsquo;all whipped</strong>, that&rsquo;s dead, man, it&rsquo;s the eulogy<br>
And <strong>whoever said what they gon&rsquo; do to me?<br>
Man, I hit your whole block up with prayers, man, y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t used to me</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick does not ask what Dee-1 would do. Given Dee-1&rsquo;s consistent, uncompromising commitment to Jesus&rsquo;s teaching above Black identity, hip hop culture, personal grievances or revolutionary philosophies, Kendrick probably knows that Dee-1 would &ldquo;show &rsquo;em just what prayer do&rdquo; without a second thought.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick sees within Dee-1 an empathetic, Christ-centered heart that Kendrick has deep inside of himself even while his hardened exterior has led him to advocate for killing the killers, burning the whole village, mortifying family members, cracking skulls, imposing agony, decapitating those who oppose him.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This contradiction between Kendricks Christian-leaning heart and his tendencies towards violence (or at least existing in an environment of violence) is a major theme of Kendrick&rsquo;s work throughout his discography.</p>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">Speaking from the heart</summary>
    
      <h4 id="i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--speaking-from-the-heart">&ldquo;I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1&rdquo; &gt; Speaking from the heart<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-be-empathetic-my-heart-like-dee-1--speaking-from-the-heart">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is worth noting that according to Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, it is not possible for someone to have a truly empathetic heart if that persons words and actions are not consistently empathetic.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same speech from St. Matthew&rsquo;s account of the Gospel where Jesus taught his disciples the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Jesus used a metaphor of trees and fruit to teach his disciples that people who have good in their heart will produce good words and actions and anyone who had evil in their heartwill produce evil words and actions. By contrast, anyone who produces evil words and actions does not truly have good in their hearts.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Beware of false prophets</strong>, who come to you <strong>in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are greedy wolves</strong>. <strong>By their fruits you will know them</strong>. Can you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, <strong>every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit</strong>. Every tree that doesn&rsquo;t grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.</em><br>
-Matthew 7:15-20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a parallel speech in St. Lluke&rsquo;s account of the Gospel according, Jesus gives the same teaching while specifically using the word heart.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from the abundance that fills a person&rsquo;s heart.</strong></em><br>
-Luke 6:43-45</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s warning against false, corrupt prophets is particularly notable given that on “Mortal Man”, throughout “DAMN.” and on “Worldwide Steppers” Kendrick has spoken about how he is prophet to the Black community in America.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, from the perspective of Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, Kendrick&rsquo;s inconsistent actions and words—particularly within &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;—would seem to indicate that there is a deep inconsistency within Kendrick&rsquo;s heart as Kendrick&rsquo;s heart seems to contain both empathy and a pathological desire for ruthless vigilante retribution.</p>

      <h4 id="but-i-will--censored">&ldquo;But I will—&rdquo; &gt; Censored<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#but-i-will--censored">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unexpectedly, Kendrick never finishes this line. He seems to be censoring himself. We are thus left to guess what Kendrick intended to say (“Dee-1” could be rhymed with “gun”).<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, the specifics of what the uncensored line might not be that important. Thus far, all the lines on the verses have been advocating for the use of violence to execute people who Kendrick judges to be detrimental to society. Almost surely, the uncensored line would have continued the same trend. The more interesting question is why amongst all the lines that contained profanity and violence, Kendrick picked this line to censor.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The censorship here could convey the idea that the uncensored line would have been so extremely violent and direct that it would make the song “X-rated”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous time that Kendrick got so specific about the way that he would kill killer was on the track “XXX.” where Kendrick rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga lil&rsquo; bit of nothin&rsquo;<br>
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap<br>
Walk myself to the court like, &ldquo;Bitch, I did that”</em><br>
<strong>X-rated</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Dee-1 does not use profanity or advocate for people to commit acts of violence, Kendrick&rsquo;s tendency towards X-rated content again positions Kendrick as someone who is in many ways the exact opposite of Dee-1.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After previously referring to his execution targets as “degenerates” Kendrick continues to escalate his rhetoric by seemingly referring to them as “devils”. Labeling his execution targets as &ldquo;devils&rdquo; again seems to be an attempt to justify certain groups of people with a sword, potentially involving more decapitations.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Heavy metal” is a subgenre of rock music which tends to feature violent and spiritually dark imagery in the song lyrics and band names.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original meaning of “heavy metals” refers to a category of chemical elements from the periodic table of elements. Kendrick thus seems to be making a subtle reference to his song “ELEMENT.” where he justified and glorified using violence to take revenge and fight against his enemies.</p>

      <h4 id="its-time-to-get-these-devils-out-the-way-heavy-metals-on-my-sword--spiritual-swordfights">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword&rdquo; &gt; Spiritual swordfights<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-time-to-get-these-devils-out-the-way-heavy-metals-on-my-sword--spiritual-swordfights">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that in St. Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Church in Ephesus, St. Paul uses the imagery of armor, swords and warfare as a metaphor to describe how Christians should fight against spiritual forces including the &ldquo;devi&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) and the “element” forces of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. <strong>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the methodology of the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”]</strong>. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but <strong>against the element</strong>, against the powers, <strong>against the world&rsquo;s rulers of the darkness of this age</strong>, and <strong>against the spiritual forces of wickedness</strong> in the heavenly places.<br>
 <br>
Therefore <strong>put on the whole armor of God</strong>, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of right relationships, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News (aka Gospel) of peace, above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to <strong>quench all the fiery darts of the evil one</strong>. And take the helmet of salvation, and <strong>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</strong>; with all prayer and requests, <strong>praying at all times in the Spirit</strong>, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints.</em><br>
 <br>
-Ephesians 6:10-18</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that passage, St. Paul makes it clear that Christians are not meant to be fighting or killing other humans (or as St. Paul says “flesh and blood”), because other humans are never the real enemy. Instead, St. Paul instructs the member of the church to go to war against “spiritual forces of wickedness”, not the humans who are doing things that are “too wicked to apologize”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to defend against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to put on “spiritual armor” which refers to virtues such as truth, right relationships, peace derived from Jesus&rsquo;s Good News, faith, salvation.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to fight offensively against “spiritual forces”, St. Paul tells Christians to wield “the sword of the Spirit” which is a metaphor for the “word of God” that is conveyed though Jesus&rsquo;s teachings as told in the texts of Bible.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St. Paul also instructs Christians to fight the spiritual war “with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit.”<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, in St. Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul made it clear that Christians are not meant to use physical weapons to fight against human enemies but spiritual weapons to fight against prideful patterns and thoughts and arguments which attempt to exalt themselves to make mak humans act according to those prideful patterns of thoughts and arguments instead of obeying Jesus&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<ul>
<li>For though we walk in the [flesh / body], <strong>we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires]</strong>, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. <strong>We are destroying arguments and all pride that exalts itself against the knowledge of God</strong>, and we are <strong>taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ</strong>.<br>
-2 Corinthians 10:3-5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, St. Paul clearly teaches Christians to “show &rsquo;em what prayer do”. Moreover, St. Paul also instructs Christians to be transformed by Jesus&rsquo;s teaching so that they can develop the kinds of virtues that will allow them to fight against prideful thoughts and arguments that would justify wickedness, including any acuments that would justify brutally killing other humans.</p>

      <h4 id="we-settle-hard-disputes-today-the-ghetto-hollywood-divorce--hollywood-divorce">&ldquo;We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce&rdquo; &gt; Hollywood divorce<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#we-settle-hard-disputes-today-the-ghetto-hollywood-divorce--hollywood-divorce">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Hard” seems to be connected to the idea of “heavy metal” on the previous line. These “hard disputes” seem to be part of some unresolvable marital conflict that will eventually end in divorce. Based on the context of the song, it would seem that Kendrick plans to settle these “hard disputes” by killing the people with whom he has a dispute.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the reference to a “ghetto Hollywood divorce”, suggests that the dispute could be “contract dispute” between Black artists and an entertainment industry company.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here Kendrick seems to be commenting on the relationship that “corporate guys” and “rappers who tell the lies” have forged to profit from distributing fabricated stories about being “street niggas just like Hollywood has profited from distributing fabricated stories.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick also seems to be alluding to the Outkast song “Hollywood Divorce”, in which Outkast, Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg used the image of a volatile Hollywood celebrity marriage as an extended metaphor for how entertainment industries appropriate Black culture only to later divorce themselves from the Black artists while holding on to the profits and intellectual property.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Starts off like a small town marriage</strong><br>
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage<br>
<strong>Now all the stars have cars, success of course<br>
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
And I&rsquo;m a star<br>
Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t have to go to Hollywood<br>
&lsquo;Cause <strong>Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on<br>
I really think they&rsquo;re stealing from us like a sample song<br>
I really wish one day we&rsquo;d take it back like Hammer&rsquo;s home</strong><br>
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home<br>
And all I got in return was a durn country song<br>
This whole country wrong<br>
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on<br>
And cut your mic on but you don&rsquo;t even write songs<br>
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra<br>
I&rsquo;m so not sober, I&rsquo;m high like a Hollywood<br>
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller<br>
Hold up, your grill&rsquo;s glistenin&rsquo;<br>
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different<br>
What&rsquo;s the real sense of it?<br>
<strong>Bling bling, I know and did you know<br>
I&rsquo;m the creator of the term</strong>, I just straightened the perm<br>
They let it sit too long, they just makin&rsquo; it burn<br>
<strong>Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn<br>
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece</strong><br>
That&rsquo;s why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease<br>
And I be&rsquo;s the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze<br>
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne<br>
But in Hollywood it&rsquo;s Litt-le Wayne, don&rsquo;t make me none<br>
So <strong>that&rsquo;s why I got a pre-nup</strong><br>
I do<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>I do, love you but you hate me at the same time</strong><br>
Lights, camera, action, it&rsquo;s game time<br>
<strong>Do you take this here as your lovely wife?<br>
To love her and cherish her for all your life?<br>
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there<br>
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s been a long time, we walked a thin line<br>
Others say they got you, but you been mine<br>
As I sit back and watch all the catfights<br>
<strong>Domestic violence — is that right?</strong><br>
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight<br>
And now I&rsquo;m growin&rsquo; up, showin&rsquo; up, blowin&rsquo; up<br>
<strong>I never ever thought that we would separate at all<br>
But you played me like a game of football<br>
Used to feed me, need me, dress me<br>
Now it&rsquo;s so messy, straight cut out and left me</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>(Starts off like a small town marriage)<br>
Hollywood divorce<br>
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing</strong><br>
(Lively wife and life, baby carriage)<br>
<strong>Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap<br>
(Now all the stars have cars, success of course)<br>
Not even talkin&rsquo; about music<br>
Everything else, too<br>
(But it ends in Hollywood divorce)<br>
By the time it reach Hollywood, it&rsquo;s over<br>
(Hollywood divorce)</strong><br>
But it&rsquo;s cool<br>
<strong>We just keep it goin&rsquo; and make new shit<br>
Take our game, take our name<br>
Give us a little fame<br>
And then they kick us to the curb, that&rsquo;s a cold thang</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>With the line, “the culture bred with carnivores”, Kendrick seems to be alluding to the famously influential lines from Jay-Z&rsquo;s 2001 song “Izzo” in which Jay-Z describe corporate leaders in the music industry as “vultures” who scavenge off Black culture</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I do this for my culture</strong>, to let &rsquo;em know<br>
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster<br>
<strong>Show &rsquo;em how to move in a room full of vultures<br>
Industry shady</strong>, it need to be taken over<br>
<strong>Label owners hate me</strong>, I&rsquo;m raisin&rsquo; the status quo up<br>
I&rsquo;m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush<br>
<strong>Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us</strong><br>
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>More recently in Migos&rsquo;s 2017 track, “T-Shirt” from their album “Culture”, Migos member, Quavo, referenced those lines from “Izzo” while discussing how &ldquo;vultures&rdquo; will &ldquo;bite&rdquo;, which is slang for stealing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it for the culture (Culture)<br>
They gon&rsquo; bite like vultures (Vultures)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carnivores that Kendrick mention here thus seem to be culture vultures who will eat artists for a snack. Kendrick specifically mentions that the carnivores will &ldquo;eat your face&rdquo;, which conveys the idea that cultures vultures seek to erase an artist&rsquo;s identity along with any associate or credit that the artist would have to their work.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the phrase “bred with carnivores”, the word &ldquo;bred&rdquo; primarily refers to the reproduction of vulture from one generation to the next. However, &ldquo;bred&rdquo; is also a double entendre for the food item “bread” which connects to the idea of vulture eating. This line then turns into a triple entendre when we realize that “bread” is also slang for “money” which would indicate that the &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; from the entertainment industry are eating up all the money that rightfully belongs to the artist.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying &ldquo;Say hello to your future fate&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be asserting that getting eaten and erased by culture vultures is guaranteed to be the fate of any artist who remains trapped in the grip of the entertainment industry for any substatial amount of time.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be warning other hip hop artists about the hard disputes and metaphorical divorce that will happen to them in the future if they sign a contract with an exploitative entertainment company.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word &ldquo;forged&rdquo; refers to a fake signature that is used to establihs a fraudulent legal agreement but is also double entendre referring to the process of shaping metal into a weapon, tool or object. This connects back to previous line about “heavy metals on my sword” that was used to &ldquo;get these devils out the way&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that the signatures are being “forged” indicates that the &ldquo;corporate guys&rdquo; in the entertainment industry are actually committing acts of fraud to illegally profit from &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and use the leverage of paid lawyers and the legal system against Black artists.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The imagery of signatures from the entertainment industry also brings to mind the <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> track “For Sale? (Interlude)” in which Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / “false accuser” / “diabolical one”) comes to Kendrick in the form of a music industry executive named Lucy. Lucy tries to get Kendrick to sign a contract to sell his soul to her in exchange for wealth, possessions and an agreement that Kendrick will stop praying and abandon his loving relationship with God the Father.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My name is Lucy, Kendrick</strong>, you introduced me, Kendrick<br>
Usually I don&rsquo;t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick<br>
Lucy give you no worries, <strong>Lucy got million stories<br>
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; fill your pockets<br>
Lucy gon&rsquo; move your mama out of Compton<br>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br>
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty</strong>, avoiding me?<br>
It&rsquo;s not so easy, <strong>I&rsquo;m at these functions accordingly</strong><br>
Kendrick, Lucy don&rsquo;t slack a minute, Lucy work harder<br>
<strong>Lucy gon&rsquo; call you even when Lucy know you love your Father<br>
I&rsquo;m Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly<br>
Lucy don&rsquo;t mind, &lsquo;cause at the end of the day you&rsquo;ll pursue me</strong><br>
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front<br>
<strong>Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork</strong><br>
I want you to know that Lucy got you<br>
All your life I watched you<br>
And now you all grown up to <strong>sign this contract</strong>,<br>
if that&rsquo;s possible</em></li>

<ul>
<li>The word &ldquo;drop&rdquo; refers to Kendrick releasing or “dropping” a new album, which is something that had been heavily anticipated during and after the battle with Drake.<br>
 </li>
<li>After hearing about sexual predators, unfaithful corporate partners, fraudulent devils and culture vultures in the entertainment industry it is no wonder that Kendrick is unenthusiastic about dropping a new album.<br>
 </li>
<li>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;, Kendrick would release his next full length album, <em>GNX</em>. Throughout <em>GNX</em> Kendrick discusse the challenges of navigating through the evil, satanic control of the entertainment industry, particular on the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After focusing on the justification for committing acts of physical violence against his enemies, it is notable that this is the first time on either verse where Kendrick has really focused on how he is being tested and tried spiritually.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be expressing the idea that he and other true artists face increasingly difficult struggles and trials as they become increasingly famous and visible to the public.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line expresses a similar idea and ethos to the Notorious B.I.G., Ma$e and Diddy’s famous song “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I don&rsquo;t know what they want from me<br>
It&rsquo;s like <strong>the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge of being tried spiritually seems to be one of the main reasons that Kendrick is &ldquo;not enthused to drop&rdquo; a new album, since droping a new album will only increase his visibility and his trials.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of increased spiritually trials coming after increased visibility is also illustrated in Gospel accounts which describe how Jesus was tried by the [&ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accusers&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;] immediately after God the Father opened the skies, spoke audibly to declare that Jesus was his &ldquo;beloved son&rdquo; and  sent the Holy Spirit in the visible form of a dove to show that Jesus is the anointed king (aka the Christ) over God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>After Jesus was baptized</strong>, he came up immediately from the water; and behold, the <strong>skies were opened</strong>, and he <strong>saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him</strong>, and behold, a voice from the skies said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” <strong>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil</strong>.</em><br>
-Matthew 3:16-4:1</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For the last few lines Kendrick has been shown himself to be very cynical about the entertainment industry, which gobbles up artists like vultures. Artists who recognize the dangers of the entertainment industry are understandably afraid and even “petrified”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the word &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; can be used as a synonym for &ldquo;afraid&rdquo;, the most concreate meaning of “petrified” refers to any kind of organic plant or animal material that is turned into stone. Organic material is petrified when water brings small minerals into the formerly living plant or animal and slowly replaces all of the organic flesh with rock-hard material.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming “petrified” actually serves as a great metaphor for hip hop as a living, flexible, organic culture being infiltrated by slick corporate guys and entertainment companies who kill hip hop artists (or more specifically kill hip hop artists consciousness as Kendrick mentioned in “Worldwide Steppers”) then seek to replace the flexible, organic culture of hip hop with a rock hard, inflexible, inorganic focus on making profit. This process eventually turns Black artists into hard-hearted individuals who are deadened to the world and can no longer grow.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that the within the Old Testament, the Prophet Ezekiel explained that God had allowed the Israelites to be defeated, dispursed and enslaved because of they had hearts of stone which did not desire God or the justice that comes from God. However, Ezekiel also prophesied about a day in the future when God would free them from slavery, bring them back to their own land and transform their old hearts of stone into new hearts of flesh which would truly desire God and be able to act with justice.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><em>For <strong>I will</strong> take you from among the nations and <strong>gather you</strong> out of all the countries, and will <strong>bring you into your own land</strong>. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and <strong>from all your idols</strong>. I will also <strong>give you a new heart</strong>, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will <strong>take away the heart of stone</strong> out of your bodies, and I will <strong>give you a heart of flesh</strong>. I will put my Spirit within you, and <strong>cause you to walk in my prescriptions</strong>. You will <strong>obey my justice and do just acts</strong>. You will reside in the land that I gave to your fathers. <strong>You will be my people, and I will be your God</strong>.</em><br>
-Ezekiel 36:24-28</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a biblical pespective, becoming &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; is thus equivalent to being enslaved or imprisoned by an oppressor due to idolatrous desire for material possessions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kendrick suggests that dealing with the evils of the entertainment industry can only lead to two possible end results for artists: Either the artist will be locked up &ldquo;in jail by Jezebel&rdquo; or &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>With either of these results, the artist will lose the freedom to create truthful works of art.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As mentioned in the analysis of the line <a href="#burn-the-whole-village-we-start-over-its-really-that-time--reqesting-fire-from-heaven-in-the-old-testament">&ldquo;Burn the whole village, we start over, it’s really that time&rdquo;</a>, Jezebel was a wicked woman who became queen of the Northern Kingdom of Israel after she married a wicked king named Ahab.After becoming queen, Jezebel replaced the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with the worship of the fertility god name Ba’al. Queen Jezebel then either killed or imprisoned most of the true prophets of God, while a hundred of God&rsquo;s prophets escaped to hide in caves.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>The prophet Elijah was the only prophet who was protected and empowered to openly confront Queen Jezebel and King Ahab. Elijah challenged the prophets of the fertility Ba’al to a competition to in which the prophets of Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Ba’al, the fertility god, would each ask the deity whom they worshiped to send down fire from the skies to burn up a sacrifice on an altar.<br>
 </li>
<li>After Yahweh, the God of Israel, proved to be the only deity capable of sending down fire from the skies, Elijah compelled the Israelites to round up the prophets of Ba’al and kill them.<br>
 </li>
<li>The death of Ba&rsquo;al&rsquo;s prophets enraged Queen Jezebel. Shen then swore that she would kill Elijah, which caused Elijah to run for his life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has repeatedly depicted himself as a prophet on “Mortal Man”, throughout DAMN. and at severl moments on other tracks. Here in &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; Kendrick the seems see himself as the modern equivalent of the prophet Elijah who is at risk of having his artistic output locked up by the wicked leaders of the entertainment industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The term &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; is used to describe a person who is noticeably being under the influence of drugs, whether prescription drugs or recreational drugs.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases, someone who is &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; may not be fully aware of their surroundings and thus is in a vulernable state in which someone could take advantage of them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of being drugged up connects back to the earlier reference to the drug MDMA in the line &ldquo;Let’s kill the followers that follow up on poppin’ mollies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current line, Kendrick seems to imply that artists who are have succumbed to their desires from pleasure and the exploitation of the entertainment industry will be drugged up with &ldquo;lies&rdquo;.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of artists being under the influence of lies also connects back to earlier lines where Kendrick ordered the execution of those who told lies or failed to provide truth to their young audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you parade in gluttony <strong>without givin&rsquo; truth to the youth</strong><br>
The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose<br>
&hellip;<br>
I think it’s time to watch the party die<br>
Street niggas and the corporate guys<br>
the <strong>rappers that report the lies</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current line, Kendrick seems to suggest that the minds of &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; eventually become altered and distorted as they become intoxicated by the lies that they have consumed and are not regurgitating to the masses.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; may also lead a person to lose consciousness.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fittingly, since the 1990s the word “conscious” has been used to describe hip hop artists such as Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Lupe Fiasco who do not gloryify violence, drugs, sexual misbehavior, gluttony, jewelry, poor financial decisions, or any other form of ignorance that might be common in commercialized, mainstream hip hop. Instead, these artists focused on positive messages that would uplift the Black community. &ldquo;Conscious&rdquo; hip hop artists are thus the exact opposite of the &ldquo;rappers that report the lies&rdquo; and become &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Stepper</em> Kendrick also discussed the concept of &ldquo;conciousness&rdquo; as being free from ego, aware, present in &ldquo;now&rdquo;, and connected to the universal or &ldquo;collective consciousness&rdquo; as described in the New Age teachings of Eckhart Tolle.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>media</strong>&rsquo;s the new religion, you <strong>killed the consciousness</strong></em>
-“Worldwide Steppers”<br>
 <br>
<em>(You really wanna know?) Do you want peace?<br>
(How I get so low?) Then watch us in the street<br>
(Only one way to go) One protest for you<br>
(Higher) Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)<br>
Vladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)<br>
But <strong>that&rsquo;s how we all think</strong> (Only one way to go)<br>
<strong>The collective conscious</strong> (Higher)<br>
Calamities on repeat, huh</em><br>
-“Savior”<br>
 <br>
*Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here<br>
Where the energy is magnified and persevered<br>
*<em>Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear<br>
Euphoria is glorified and made His</em><br>
-“The Heart Part 5”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases the term, &ldquo;drugged up&rdquo; or just &ldquo;drugged&rdquo; may also be used to describe women (or sometimes men) who have unknowingly consumed a drug that was given to them by a sexual predator who intends to sexually assault or abuse the &ldquo;drugged&rdquo; person once they lose awareness or consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sexual assault could imply that rappers and artists are being &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo; because they are being &ldquo;fucked over&rdquo; by the predatory leaders of the entertainment industry. Kendrick previously asserted that artists are getting duped into unfaithful relationships, &ldquo;fucked over&rdquo;, and killed by the entertainment industry on the track &ldquo;N95&rdquo; from <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Stepper</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The industry wants<br>
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box</strong><br>
While <strong>they makin&rsquo; a mockery followin&rsquo; us</strong><br>
This ain&rsquo;t Monopoly<br>
Watchin&rsquo; for love<br>
<strong>This ain&rsquo;t monogamy<br>
Y&rsquo;all gettin&rsquo; fucked</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sexual assault could also connect back to Kendrick allegagions of Drake and his crew being sexual predators who traffic girls to sex parties at Drake&rsquo;s mansion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold;">The Sunken Place</summary>
    
      <h4 id="im-pitiful-sunken-place-soon-as-im-question-in-my-pride--the-sunken-place">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pitiful, sunken place soon as I&rsquo;m question in&rsquo; my pride&rdquo; &gt; The &ldquo;Sunken Place&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#im-pitiful-sunken-place-soon-as-im-question-in-my-pride--the-sunken-place">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here Kendrick talks about being pitiful and in the “Sunken Place”, which is a reference to the movie <strong>Get Out</strong>.<br>
    </p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Get Out</em> a Black male protagonist named Chris goes to visit his white girlfriend&rsquo;s wealthy family at a secluded estate. Although the family is very friendly—actually too friendly—he begins to notice strange behavior, particularly from the Black woman who serves as housekeeper and the Black man who serves as a groundskeeper.<br>
 </li>
<li>One evening, the Black protagonist has a private conversation with his white girlfriend’s mother. The mother starts asking very probing questions about his personal trauma while using the sound of a spoon stirring around a teacup to hypnotize the Black protagonist.<br>
 </li>
<li>As he talks about his traumatic life experiences the Black protagonist feels pitiful and soon becomes paralyzed and cannot move even though he is still awake. However, then the mother says “Now sink into the floor. Sink!”<br>
 </li>
<li>At that point the Black protagonist’s consciousness becomes totally disconnected or dissociated from his body and sent down to what the mother calls “the sunken place”. In the “sunken place” he faintly see what’s going on around him but is unable to move his body or do anything about it.<br>
 </li>
<li>Later on the White mother keeps the Black protagonist in the hypnotized state long enough to strap him to a restraining chair in the basement. The Black protagonist then learns that the family uses the daughter to attract black people and bring them to her family’s estate where they are hypnotized with the consciousness sent to the sunken place. The family then takes over the Black person’s body and transfers the consciousness of older, “degenerate” White person into the Black person’s stolen body stolen body.<br>
 </li>
<li>The protagonists learns that Black woman who is serving as the housekeeper and the Black man who is serving as the groundskeeper are Black people whose bodies were previously stolen so that their consciousness could be replaced by the consciousness of the girlfriend’s grandmother and grandfather respectively.<br>
 </li>
<li>The Black protagonist refuses to be a victim of this plot. He manages to free himself from the restraining chair before his body is stolen and kill several members of the family before escaping from the estate with the help of his Black friend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to be referencing the plot of <em>Get Out</em> as a metaphor for what the White-owned entertainment industry is doing to Black artists and Black culture.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The White owned entertainment industry is sending out corporate White folks to attract Black artists to come join the the White entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Black artist is in the building, the White industry folks hypnotize and paralyze Black artists by getting them to keep talking about their traumatic life experiences until they feel pitiful.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is similar to the experiences that Kendrick alluded to on “Mother I Sober” when he rapped:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Traded in my tears for a Range Rover”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The White industry folk then forces the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness (aka the &ldquo;Sunken Place&rdquo;) where they become disconnected and dissociated from what’s going on around them.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After forcing the Black artist into a state of unconsciousness, the White corporate industry folk can then steal the Black artist’s body of work (e.g. the master recording of a music artist) and give it to a degenerate White person to own as his or her own body of work while the Black artist is still trapped in the “Sunken Place”.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>It is notable that the word “corporate” comes from the Latin word “corporātiō” which literally means “the assumption or taking on of a body”<br>
 </li>
<li>This idea of stealing a Black artist&rsquo;s body (of work) also mirrors the metaphor of petrification where White corporate industry folk kill the Black artist’s consciousness, penetrate into their body of work, and slowly replace the flexible, organic flesh with rock hard, inflexible, inorganic minerals until the body is just a hard relic of a past life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick, like the protagonists of Get Out is one of the few Black artists who has been able to regain consciousness, free himself from the restraints of his original contract, and now seems poised to kill the White industry folk so that he can escape before they try to send his consciousness back to the &ldquo;Sunken Place.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick finds himself in the &ldquo;Sunken Place&rdquo; whenever he “questions his pride”. The might convey the idea that the entertainment industry wants Kendrick to remain under the influence of his own pride, so that he will make bad decisions and be easier to control.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick has discussed his internal struggle between pride and humility throughout much of his work.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The days I tried to cover up and conceal<br>

<ul>
<li>The term “blacking out” typically refers to the experience of going into a state of unconsciousness. The idea of unconscioussness connects back to the idea of artists being &ldquo;drugged up full of lies&rdquo; as discussed in a previous line.</li>

<p>A &ldquo;relapse&rdquo; is a setback in deteriation in someone&rsquo;s health after previous improvement. The term is most often used to describe the experience in which someone who had previously broken free from an addiction to a drug or stimulating activity returns to their addiction.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the context of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; a &ldquo;relapsin&rsquo; one thought at a time&rdquo; might imply that the spiritual and physical struggles with the entertainment industry are causing Kendrick to fall back into destructive ways of thought after previously being &ldquo;drugged up full of lies.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that throughout <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>, Kendrick reveals his struggle with sex addition that was exacerbated by being a famous touring artist in the entertainment industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I met her on the third night of Chicago<br>

Fee-fi-fo-fum, <strong>she was a model</strong><br>
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible<br>
<strong>Eyes light green</strong>, penetratin&rsquo; the moonlight<br>
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like<br>
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin&rsquo; you hear me<br>
Phone off the ringer, tell the world I&rsquo;m busy<br>
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn&rsquo;t care enough<br>
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang<br>

I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin&rsquo; manhood<br>

<li>
<p>Kendrick seems to realize that his susceptibility to addition is fueled by his own pattern of thoughts. This echoes St. Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians in which he told Chrsitians that they are not fighting a physical battle against other humans but a spiritual battle against arrogant thoughts and arguments that lead to prideful exaltation and prevent humans from knowing God in a loving relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For though we walk in the [flesh / body], <strong>we do not wage battle according to the [flesh / bodily desires]</strong>, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the [flesh / bodily desires], but are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. <strong>We are destroying arguments and all arrogance that exalts itself against the knowledge of God</strong>, and we are <strong>taking every thought captive to make those thoughts obedient to Christ</strong>.</em><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “spare no feelings” describes someone who is acting without any concern of how his or her actions could hurt someone else’s feelings.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kendrick’s relapse seems to have put him into a mental state where he only cares about his own feelings and no longer cares about the feelings of others. Such a state of mind is the exact opposite of empathy and thus undermines the earlier line when he said “I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1”<br>
 </p>

<p>Kendrick previously expressed his paranoid, troubled and unempathetic state of mind when he was overwhelmed by his feelings on the track “FEEL.” from <em>DAMN.</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To be “in one’s feelings” refers to a mental state in which someone is so emotionally dysregulated, overwhelmed or affected that they can no longer think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that “In My Feelings” is also the title of Drake&rsquo;s record-breaking number one single from his 2018 album, <em>Scorpion</em>. On the track, Drake sings and raps about many of his typical themes including his feelings and sexual desire for numerous women.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap, TrapMoneyBenny<br>
<strong>This shit got me in my feelings</strong>*<br>
Gotta be real with it, yeah<br>
 <br>
<em><strong>Kiki, do you love me?</strong> Are you riding?<br>
Say you&rsquo;ll never ever leave from beside me<br>
<strong>&lsquo;Cause I want ya, and I need ya</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m down for you always<br>
<strong>KB, do you love me?</strong> Are you riding?<br>
Say you&rsquo;ll never ever leave from beside me<br>
<strong>&lsquo;Cause I want ya, and I need ya</strong><br>
And I&rsquo;m down for you always</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;In My Feelings&rdquo; also exemplifies how Drake has used social media, influencers and corporate marketing tactics to significantly increase his commercial success. On the same day that the album Scorpion was released, a social media comedian named Shiggy posted a video of him dancing to this chorus. This video soon went viral and was then turned into a the social media #InMyFeelingsChallenge and #KikiChallenge which later added riskier elements like dancing outside of moving cars. These viral trends helped to elevate the track to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart giving Drake the record for most number one hits of rapper in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the context Kendrick’s lyrics “slide” is usually slang for the act of killing someone.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I said, tell me who you loyal to<br>
Is it anybody that you would lie for?<br>
<strong>Anybody you would slide for?</strong><br>
Anybody you would die for?</em><br>
-&ldquo;LOYALTY.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
<em>Eight billion people on Earth, <strong>silent murderers</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
I caught a couple of bodies myself, <strong>slid my community</strong><br>
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies<br>
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient<br>
But <strong>because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin&rsquo;</strong></em><br>
-&ldquo;Worldwide Steppers&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my feelings when I slide&rdquo;, Kendrick seems to be suggesting that whenever he tries to kill (aka slide) people, he is only doing so because he is emotionally dysregulated and unable to think rationally, strategically, objectively or empathetically.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This line thus gives a whole new perspective and context to &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;. The whole time that he has been advocating to kill the killers and commit acts of unspeakable violence may really just be evidence that Kendrick is emotionally dysregulated and unable to consider the ramifications or consequences of his words and actions. He seems to have been in a totally &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo;  state throughout this track.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the same logic, one could also conclude that throughout the battle tracks where Kendrick seemingly tried to kill Drake&rsquo;s career, Kendrick was &ldquo;in his feelings&rdquo; and unable to be empathetic towards Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few months after the release of &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo; when Kendrick released the track &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; as the centerpiece of the album <em>GNX</em> , Kendrick seemed to confirm that his actions during the battle with Drake were largely a result of Kendrick being &ldquo;in his feelings&rdquo;. On &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; Kendrick rapped from the perspective of God the Father who told Kendrick that he was a reincarnated version of Lucifer (aka the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; / &ldquo;satan&rdquo; / &ldquo;false accusers&rdquo; / &ldquo;diabolical one&rdquo;) who &ldquo;loved war&rdquo; and and was kicked out of heaven because his feelings of anxiety led him to do evil. In response, Kendrick acknowledged that all he ever really wanted was to feel &ldquo;love and approval&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;<strong>Son you do well but your heart is closed</strong><br>
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself&quot;<br>
Father I&rsquo;m not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down<br>
&ldquo;But your pride has to die, &quot;<br>
Okay father show me how<br>
&ldquo;Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for&rdquo;<br>
I kept one hundred institutions paid, &ldquo;Okay, tell me more&rdquo;<br>
I put one hundred hoods on one stage, &ldquo;Okay, tell me more&rdquo;<br>
<strong>I&rsquo;m tryna push peace in LA, &ldquo;But you love war&rdquo;</strong><br>
No, I don&rsquo;t, &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do, &quot; okay then tell me the truth<br>
&ldquo;Every individual is only a version of you<br>
<strong>How can they forgive when there&rsquo;s no forgiveness in your heart?</strong>&rdquo;<br>
I could tell You where I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;I could tell you who you are<br>
You fell out of heaven &lsquo;cause <strong>you was anxious</strong><br>
Didn&rsquo;t like authority, only searched to be heinous<br>
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent<br>
My greatest music director was you<br>
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues<br>
It was harmony and motion<br>
<strong>I sent you down to earth &lsquo;cause you was broken<br>
Rehabilitation not psychosis</strong><br>
But now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music<br>
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving<br>
You came a long way from garnishing evil-ish views&rdquo;<br>
And <strong>all I ever wanted from You was love and approval</strong><br>
I learned a lot, <strong>no more putting these people in fear</strong><br>
The more that word is diminished, the more it&rsquo;s not real<br>
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel<br>
I&rsquo;m using words for inspiration as an ideal<br>
&ldquo;So can you promise that you won&rsquo;t take your gifts for granted?&rdquo;<br>
I promise that I&rsquo;ll use my gifts to bring understanding<br>
&ldquo;For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?&rdquo;<br>
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now<br>
<strong>&ldquo;You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity&rdquo;<br>
And I&rsquo;m ashamed that I ever created that enemy</strong></em></li>

      <h4 id="im-in-my-feelings-when-i-slide-i-mean--toosie-slide">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my feelings when I slide, I mean&rdquo; &gt; Toosie Slide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#im-in-my-feelings-when-i-slide-i-mean--toosie-slide">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to using the word &ldquo;slide&rdquo; to refer to killing, on the battle track, &ldquo;6:16 in LA&rdquo;, Kendrick used the word &ldquo;slide&rdquo; in reference to &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo;, Drake&rsquo;s number one hit and accompanying viral dance trend from 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person<br>
Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it<br>
<strong>Can&rsquo;t Toosie Slide up outta this one</strong>, it&rsquo;s just gon&rsquo; resurface<br>
Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Drake used influencers and viral social media trends to significantly increase the commercial success of &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo; in a more enhanced version of his strategy for &ldquo;In My Feelings&rdquo; four years earlier.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Toosie Slide” was released as a single in April, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns and named after a then 23 year old named Toosie.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toosie is a Black social media dancer and influencer from Atlanta who had a big break into the music industry when he linked up with fellow Atlanta-native and rapper Future eventually joining Future on the Summer Sixteen Tour with Future, a tour which also features Drake.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Drake needed another social media dance trend to popularize a new song, he direct messaged Toosie on social media and asked Toosie to make up a dance based on the hook of an unfinished song. That request turned into a modern “Cha Cha Slide”-style dance and viral social media video which featured the song’s hook.<br>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fact that Drake used his connection with Atlanta native rapper, Future, and Future’s Atlanta native dancer, Toosie, also highlights the criticism that Kendrick made on “Not Like Us”. Throughout the third verse of &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; Kendrick accused Drake of colonizing Black culture particularly by using Atlanta-based artists to make commercialized hits that could make Drake rich.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Once upon a time, all of us was in chains<br>
Homie still doubled down callin&rsquo; us some slaves<br>
<strong>Atlanta was the Mecca</strong>, buildin&rsquo; railroads and trains<br>
Bear with me for a second, let me put y&rsquo;all on game<br>
<strong>The settlers was usin&rsquo; townfolk to make &rsquo;em richer<br>
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance</strong><br>
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge<br>
<strong>You called Future when you didn&rsquo;t see the club</strong> (Ayy, what?)<br>
<strong>Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up</strong> (What?)<br>
<strong>21 gave you false street cred</strong><br>
<strong>Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head</strong> (Ayy, what?)<br>
<strong>Quavo said you can be from Northside</strong> (What?)<br>
<strong>2 Chainz say you good, but he lied<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars<br>
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin&rsquo; colonizer</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Toosie’s video had already gone viral Drake released the official music video for the full song which was now titled “Toosie Slide”. The video showed Drake wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask and doing Toosi’s dance while going through a tour of his mansion during the COVID lockdown.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the surface, “Toosie Slide” seems like just a dance song with melodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Baby, don&rsquo;t you wanna dance with me?</strong> No?<br>
I could dance like Michael Jackson<br>
I could give you satisfaction<br>
And you know we out here every day with it<br>
I&rsquo;ma show you how to get it<br>
&hellip;<br>
It go <strong>right foot up, left foot, slide</strong><br>
<strong>Left foot up, right foot, slide</strong><br>
Basically, I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;, <strong>either way, we &lsquo;bout to slide</strong>, ayy<br>
<strong>Can&rsquo;t let this one slide</strong>, ayy (Who&rsquo;s bad?)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if one pays close attention to the lyrics one can hear that Drake is actually trying to “act tough” and portay himself as a &ldquo;street nigga&rdquo; as he uses the word “slide” to simultaneously refer to the dance and to the act of vengefully killing his enemies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Got so many opps</strong>, I be mistakin&rsquo; opps for other opps<br>
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots<br>
Other than the family I got, it&rsquo;s either you or me<br>
<strong>That&rsquo;s just how I think, it&rsquo;s either you or me</strong><br>
This life got too deep for you, baby<br>
<strong>Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin’</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Black leather glove, no sequins<br>
Buckles on the jacket, it&rsquo;s Alyx shit<br>
<strong>Nike crossbody, got a piece in it<br>
Got a dance, but it&rsquo;s really on some street shit</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ma show you how to get it*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on the battle track &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; Kendrick says that he would like Drake to keep making songs with catchy melodies that make everyone dance instead of trying to &ldquo;act tough&rdquo;. Kendrick even implied that if Drake focused on making dance songs, Kendrick would have no reason to threaten Drake with diss songs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I like Drake with the melodies, I don&rsquo;t like Drake when he act tough</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed<br>
<strong>Keep makin&rsquo; me dance, wavin&rsquo; my hand, and it won&rsquo;t be no threat</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the battle track &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo;, Kendrick also seems to mock Drake’s attempt to make viral dance hits like “Toosie Slide” by chanting the following dance instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Let me hear you say, &ldquo;OV-ho&rdquo; (OV-ho)<br>
Say, &ldquo;OV-ho&rdquo; (OV-ho)<br>
<strong>Then step this way, step that way<br>
Then step this way, step that way</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also on the video for “Not Like Us”, there is scene where Kendrick is standing on a dark street. Just behinda Kendrick, a menacing man approaches wearing an all black shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, gloves and a black ski mask just like Drake did in the “Toosie Slide” video. However, before the man has a chance to put a hand on Kendrick the man is suddenly thrown backwards almost as if there was some kind of supernatural force protecting Kendrick.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of these references to &ldquo;Toosie Slide&rdquo; along with the slang meaning of &ldquo;slide&rdquo; seem to suggest that Drake&rsquo;s actions over a number of years are the exact things that Kendrick has judged to be punishable by execution throughout &ldquo;Watch the Party Die&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick transitions away from discussion on his spiritual, physical and emotional trials withing the entertainment industry and once again wonders out loud what Lecrae would do as a Black man and a hip hop artist who has faced many similar trials and challenges.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that instead of saying “<em><strong>I</strong></em> wonder what Lecrae would do&quot;, he now says “<em><strong>a nigga</strong></em> wonder what Lecrae would do&quot;, almost as if it is a question that any Black person should be wondering.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For context, Lecrae has had to deal with his fair share of public controversy and conflict with White Christians who began to take offense at Lecrae when after Lecdrated started speaking about racial justice issues that were affecting the Black community.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because White (Evangelical) Christians represent the largest consumer demographic for Christian hip hop, speaking out about racial justice put Lecrae at odds with the White -wned entertainment industry who wanted to co-opt his music and act like they owned him. Lecraes details these dynamics on several tracks on Lecrae’s 2017 album <em>All Things Work Together for Good</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Learned a lot over these last few years<br>

<ul>
<li>“Flooding the market” refers to the act of releasing a large quantity of a particular product into the a particular market in a short period of time.<br>
 </li>
<li>For Kendrick, flooding the market could refer to the release of the current track and a subsequent album which would flood the music market with sales and streams. The idea of &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; music also connects to the theme of water introduced by the word &ldquo;flood&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea of a market where people pay for goods and services also connects to the idea of “paying dues”. &ldquo;Paying dues&rdquo; a phrase that refers working hard with a great deal of patience, endurance and commitment to the little things in order to earn respect and an opportunity to take on a much larger or more visible role.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While rapping from Nispey’s perspective on “The Heart Part 5”, Kendrick uses the phrase “paid dues” to describe the hard work that Nipsey Hussle put into the rap game  by releasing 13 mixtapes in 12 years from 2005 to 2017 before releasing his only studio album in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reflectin&rsquo; on my life and what I done<br>
<strong>Paid dues</strong>, made rules, change outta love<br>
Them same views made schools change curriculums</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “I paid your dues”, Kendrick would seem to be talking to someone who did not work hard to earn respect. This could be a reference to Drake, whom Kendrick has repeatedly criticized for using ghostwriters to write his rap lyrics instead of putting in the work to write his own lyrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly , on “euphoria” and “meet the grahams”, Kendrick criticized Drake for receiving Ozempic weight loss injection, having abdominal surgery to improve his appearance without needing to pay his dues by working out.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yeah, my first one like my last one, it&rsquo;s a classic, you don&rsquo;t have one<br>
Let your core audience <strong>stomach that, then tell &rsquo;em where you get your abs from</strong></em><br>
-“euphoria”<br>
 <br>
<em>Even if it don&rsquo;t benefit your goals, <strong>do some push-ups, get some discipline<br>
Don&rsquo;t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did<br>
Don&rsquo;t pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership</strong></em><br>
-“meet the grahams”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By saying “paid your dues”, Kendrick could also be saying that Drake never did the hard, therapeutic work of self-examination to understand how he needs to grow and mature. This lack of self-examination left Kendrick to do the examination work for Drake, which resulted in the astute criticisms that Kendrick made throughout all the battle tracks.</p>

<ul>
<li>By saying “it’s up”, Kendrick could be indicating that the “time is up”, which would connect back to the first line of each verse which said “It’s time to watch the party die”.<br>
 </li>
<li>Kendrick asserts that the death of &ldquo;the party&rdquo; will be bad news to those who &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t one of ours&rdquo;.<br>
 </li>
<li>Using the phrase &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t one of ours&rdquo; to refer to people outside of the community or outside of the circle of trust mirrors the core mesage of the battle track &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; where Kendrick mentions Drake and the members of Drake&rsquo;s crew by name prior to the chorus where Kenrick repeatedly said &ldquo;They not like us.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick’s hometown friend, Jay (or Jason) Estrada is Compton-native athletic fitness trainer who worked as a strength trainer for the 2016 U.S.A. Olympic basketball teams. Additionally, Jay Estrada has also trained other NBA players including Compton-native DeMar Derozan, who made a guest appearance in the “Not Like Us” video after Kendrick name dropped him in the second verse of “Not Like Us”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By working out with Jay Estrada, Kendrick is again showing himself to be someone who pays his own dues in contrast to Drake who allegedly paid for for the shortcut of Ozempic and abdominal surgery based on Kendrick&rsquo;s words to Drake&rsquo;s son on &ldquo;meet the grahams&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Even if it don&rsquo;t benefit your goals, <strong>do some push-ups, get some discipline<br>
Don&rsquo;t cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did</strong><br>
Don&rsquo;t pay to play with them Brazilians, <strong>get a gym membership</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable, that Kendrick’s advice to Drake’s son to “do some push-ups” is a direct response to “Push Ups”, Drake’s initial diss track where Drake mocked Kendrick for a viral social media video which shoed Kendrick doing push-ups in a park.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drake used the image of Kendrick doing push-ups as a metaphor for Kendrick getting coerced into a disadvantageous financial situation by Top Dawg, the Black owner of Kendrick’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Drake asserted that every time Top Dawg told Kendrick to “drop” (i.e. drop to the ground as a metaphor for dropping an album), Kendrick had to give Top Dawg “fifty” (i.e. fifty push ups as a metaphor for 50% of the royalties from Kedrick’s music releases).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up<br>
&lsquo;Cause Top told you, &ldquo;Drop and give me fifty,&rdquo; like some push-ups</strong>, huh<br>
&hellip;<br>
<strong>Pull your contract &lsquo;cause we gotta see the split<br>
The way you doin&rsquo; splits, bitch, your pants might rip</strong><br>
You better do that motherfuckin&rsquo; show inside the bity<br>
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty<br>
Then we need a verse for the Swifties<br>
<strong>Top say drop, you better drop and give &rsquo;em fifty</strong><br>
&hellip;<br>
Ayy, <strong>better drop and give me fifty, ayy<br>
Drop and give me fifty, drop and give me fifty</strong>, ayy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Kendrick’s perspective, by choosing to mock Kendrick for doing push up exercise and working hard for Top Dawg, Drake is exposing himself as someone who would rather cheat and sell himself to the White owned entertainment industry instead of working hard to pay his dues.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Katt William&rsquo;s viral Club Shay Shay interview that Kendrick alluded to on “meet the grahams”, Katt Wiliams made the exact same point against comics and entertainers who sold out to the White owned entertainment industry used ghostwriters and did not pay their dues or otherwise gave up on working hard. Katt Williams compared these people to athletes or body builders who use performance enhancing drugs to avoid putting in the hard work of exercising but still want people to impressed with their bodies.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“You gotta burn it down to build it up” would seem to be a statement that Jay Estrada would make in the context of strength and fitness training.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to build stronger muscles, an athlete first has to break down the existing muscle by lifting, pressing or pulling weights or some other kind of resistance. These kinds of exercises create tiny microtears in muscle fibers that are accompanied by a burning sensation in the muscles. This burning sensation is what is being referred to by the exercise term “feel the burn”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of “burn it down to build it up” could be applied to much of the violent language that Kendrick has used when acting like a totalitarian dictator who is trying to purge society and “burn the whole village” so “we can start over” with the hope of building a “new earth”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, if we see Kendrick’s fierce criticism and exposure of Drake as a way to “burn it down to build it up”, the natural conclusion is that Kendrick actually wants Drake to be built up into a better person.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act of “tough love” is consistent with Kendrick’s words on “meet the grahams” where he explained his motives for engaging in a rap battle with Drake.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The phrase “locked in” is most often used to describe someone who is focused on their goal, which connects to the themes of paying dues and working out in the previous lines. Here Kendrick says he is focused on (i.e. locked in to) “what he trusts”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that Kendrick’s rap battle with Drake started when Kendrick was featured on the song “Like That” on Future and Metro Boomin’s album titled, <em>We Don’t Trust You</em>. That album title seems to have been a statement about Drake, who the two Atlanta-native artists had previously worked with but no longer trusted.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the battle, Kendrick repeatedly accused Drake of being an actor, manipulator and liar who cannot be trusted.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The famous actor</strong> we once knew is lookin&rsquo; paranoid and now spiralin&rsquo;<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Since Kendrick does trust Drake he looks “outside” to find what he does trust. Here “outside” seems to refer to the world around Kendrick, or maybe more specifically the city around him—the city of Compton.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association with the city of Compton being “outside” seems to be highlighted on “Not Like Us” where in quick succession Kendrick mentions Drake—the liar and false god, who need to be locked inside (a jail cell)—in contrast to the city that is free to be outside.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Devil is a lie, he a 69 God</strong>, ayy<br>
<strong>Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside</strong>, ayy<br>
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of &lsquo;za, ayy<br>
<strong>City is back up, it&rsquo;s a must, we outside</strong>, ayy</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The music video of &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; further emphisizes the contrast between the city of Compton being free outside with numerous shots of large crowds filling the plaza of the Compton City Hall and Civic Center while Drake&rsquo;s OVO owl is locked up inside a birdcage. Notably, the owl in the birdcage is shown in the second to last shot right before the video cuts back a final shot of the large crowd dancing at the Compton City Hall and Civic Center under a sculture dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr..</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kendrick ends that song by declaring that at some point between the beginning and end of this song, Kendrick has watched the party die, likely as a result of Kendrick&rsquo;s execution orders.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast to the party—which will not go on tomorrow—,Kendrick highlights the kids who are now able to live tomorrow.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mention of kids is likely a reference to Kendrick’s allegation that Drake and his crew were trafficking underaged girls to for Drake and his crew to have sex with at parities. At the same time, uncompromising artists such as Katt Williams has sought to expose that powerful men engaging in predatory sexual behavior is a widespread, endemic problem throughout the entertainment industry.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The future for kids has been a central focus for Kendrick since he became a father as can be seen throughout <em>Mr. Morale and the Big Stepper</em>’s theme of breaking generational curses - particularly curses that related to sexual abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Playin&rsquo; &ldquo;Baby Shark&rdquo; with my daughter<br>

Never lied, but <strong>no one believed me when I said &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t</strong>&rdquo;<br>

<strong>&ldquo;Did he touch you?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No&rdquo; again, still they didn&rsquo;t believe me</strong><br>

<strong>I asked my momma why she didn&rsquo;t believe me when I told her &ldquo;No&rdquo;<br>

<strong>I pray our children don&rsquo;t inherit me and feelings I attract<br>
A conversation not bein&rsquo; addressed in Black families<br>
The devastation, hauntin&rsquo; generations and humanity<br>
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters<br>
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other<br>
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain&rsquo;t recovered<br>
Still livin&rsquo; as victims</strong> in the public eyes who pledge allegiance<br>
<strong>Every other brother has been compromised<br>
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused<br>
I see &rsquo;em daily buryin&rsquo; they pain in chains and tattoos</strong><br>
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move<br>
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school<br>
His anger grows deep in misogyny<br>
<strong>This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active</strong><br>
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made<br>
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame<br>
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother&rsquo;s pain<br>
I hope Hykeem made you proud &lsquo;cause you ain&rsquo;t die in vain<br>
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all<br>
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God<br>
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred<br>
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae&rsquo;s track “Die for the Party” features the exact same beat as Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s “Watch the Party Die”. As Lecrae mentions here, “Die for the Party” is meant to serve as an additional verse for “Watch the Party Die”.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae decided to release this verse on his own rather than Kendrick inviting him to do so as part of a remix or extended version. That being said, on two separate lines within the second verse of “Watch the Party Die”, Kendrick did say that he wondered “what Lecrae would do”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do<br>
Fuck these niggas up or show &rsquo;em just what prayer do?<br>
&hellip;<br>
A nigga wonder what Lecrae would do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecrae thus seems to have reasonably concluded that those two lines from “Watch the Party Die” were an open invitation for him to write and release his verse on &ldquo;Die for the Party&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lecrae here makes a reference to the Jay-Z’s classic and often quoted lines from the 2001 track “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” where Kendricks challenges the status quo of the music industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I do this for my culture, to let &rsquo;em know<br>
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster<br>
Show &rsquo;em how to move in a room full of vultures<br>
Industry shady</strong>, it need to be taken over<br>
<strong>Label owners hate me</strong>, I&rsquo;m raisin&rsquo; the status quo up<br>
I&rsquo;m overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush<br>
Pay us like you owe us for &amp;&amp;all the years that you hoed us</em>*<br>
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that on the second verse of “Watch the Party Die” Kendrick also makes a subtle reference to these exact lines from &ldquo;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Say hello to your future fate, <strong>the culture bred with carnivores<br>
You let &rsquo;em snack, they eat your face</strong>, the signatures is bein&rsquo; forged</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In slang, the phrase “clout-chasing” is used to describe a person who seeks attention, fame, or influence, often by engaging in behavior that attracts public interest or aligns that themself with popular trends or influential figures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases, rappers are accused of “clout-chasing” when they directly name more famous hip hop artists in order to associate themselves with more famous artist without actually being invited to collaborate with the such famous artist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Clout chasers&rdquo; can be seen as a form of “culture vulture” since &ldquo;clout chasers&rdquo; are metaphorically scavenging off of someone else who has been “killing it” rather than using their own skills, discipline or hard work to eat what they kill. Thus, &ldquo;clout chasing&rdquo; is also a way for someone to avoid &ldquo;paying dues&rdquo; or working hard, as Kendrick mentioned in the first verse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is notable that on the battle track &ldquo;THE HEART PART 6&rdquo;, Drake accused Kendrick of &ldquo;clout chasing&rdquo; as Drake denied Kendrick&rsquo;s allegations that Drake was involved in pedophilia and sex trafficing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Album droppin&rsquo; soon, no wonder <strong>you turn to a clout chaser &lsquo;stead of doin&rsquo; hard labor</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecrae suggests that “culture vulture” rappers turn to &ldquo;clout-chasing&rdquo; in order to “prove their worth”. This psychological need to prove one’s own worth through success as a rapper is a vice with which Lecrae has personally struggled even as he is learning to find his identity in who God made him to be.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During Lecrae’s own <a href="https://youtu.be/y2ZC1FEk87Q?si=-DgVA8e6vesTqSTw&amp;t=1195">The Deep End</a> podcast episode where he discussed the battle between Kendrick and Drake, Lecrae concluded that the main problem with the battle was that both rappers were trying to tear down their rival in order to obtain a false sense of value and worth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It becomes a problem when your identity is on the line a war trying to tear down someone&rsquo;s identity</strong> it&rsquo;s not me trying to best you to show you you&rsquo;re fake and I&rsquo;m real it&rsquo;s not me trying to best you to show you that I&rsquo;m superior to you and that is the ultimate problem with finding our worth in what we do. <strong>What we tend to do is find the quality of our work as the quality of our worth and I think that&rsquo;s a lot of what we&rsquo;re seeing between these guys which I think is so unhealthy because at the end of the day you&rsquo;re in order to be great you&rsquo;ve got to have someone less than you—that you got to have someone to step on in order for you to have value and worth</strong>. If we&rsquo;re talking about the quality of our work—if your identity is shaped by what you do and being the best at it, then you got to step on someone else to prove that you are worthy of whatever it is you say you are.<br>
 <br>
So, at the end of the day, <strong>I think the real battle is between whenever you make anything like your ability or your body or your looks a part of your identity, they’ll ultimately begin to crush you. Those things are going to crush you because they&rsquo;ve got to always measure up. When they don&rsquo;t measure up, now your identity and your value are worthless.</strong><br>
 <br>
So I wouldn’t be surprised if internally Drake is feeling a sense of worthlessness … I wouldn’t be surprised if he has to go look at the things he&rsquo;s done to remind himself of his worth.<br>
 <br>
I remember when I was in high school, and <strong>in high school, my value was being the dope rapper</strong>. … And here comes Steve from Brooklyn. He&rsquo;s kicking metaphors and similes and bars and references. I was just destroyed. And because of that, <strong>my value was now in question. My identity, my worth, was in question</strong>.<br>
 <br>
So what did I do? I had two choices: I could either run away from him so that I could maintain some semblance of value, or I could associate with him so I could regain some sense of value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the good news is, I became a better rapper. The bad news is that <strong>all it did was reignite a false sense of self-worth and identity</strong>, to where, fast forward, I’m writing a song about identity because <strong>I’m still wrestling with that reality</strong>.<br>
 <br>
And <strong>God already told me I mattered. He told me in scripture. I mean, the creator of creation Himself knows me by name, and I’m still fighting. I’m still fighting for a false sense of identity.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
